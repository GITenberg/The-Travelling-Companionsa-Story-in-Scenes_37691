<h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><i>Extremes Meet.</i></h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>An Excursion Agent's Offices. Behind the counters polite and
patient Clerks are besieged by a crowd of Intending Tourists, all asking
questions at once.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">First Intending Tourist.</span> Here&mdash;have you made out that estimate
for me yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clerk.</span> In one moment, Sir. (<i>He refers to a list, turns over innumerable
books, jots down columns of francs, marks, and florins; reduces
them to English money, and adds them up.</i>) First class fares on the Rhine,
Danube and Black Sea steamers, I think you said, second class rail, and
postwagen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Int. T.</span> I did say so, I believe; but you had better make it
second class all through, and I can always pay the difference if I want to.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> <i>alters the sums accordingly, and adds up again.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Clerk.</span> Fifty-five pounds fourteen and a penny, Sir. Shall I make
you out the tickets now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Int. T.</span> Um, no. On second thoughts, I'd like to see one
of your short Circular Tours for the English Lakes, or Wales, before
I decide.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> <i>hands him a quantity of leaflets, with which he retires.</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Clarendon Culchard</span>, <i>age about twenty-eight; in Somerset
House; tall; wears glasses, stoops slightly, dresses carefully, though his
tall hat is of the last fashion but two. He looks about him expectantly,
and then sits down to wait.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>to himself</i>). No sign of him yet! I <i>do</i> like a man to keep
an appointment. If this is the way he <i>begins</i>&mdash;I have my doubts whether
he is <i>quite</i> the sort of fellow to&mdash;but I took the precaution to ask Hugh
Rose about him, and Rose said he was the best company in the world,
and I couldn't help getting on with him. I don't think Rose would
deceive me. And from all I've seen of Podbury, he seems a pleasant
fellow enough. What a Babel! All these people bent on pleasure, going
to seek it in as many directions&mdash;with what success no one can predict.
There's an idea for a sonnet there.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He brings out a pocket-book, and begins to write&mdash;"As when a&mdash;&mdash;"</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">An Amurrcan Citizen</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span>). See here, I've been around
with your tickets in Yurrup, and when I was at Vernis, I bought
some goods at a store there, and paid cash down for 'em, and they
promised to send 'em on for me right here, and that was last fall,
and I've never heard any more of 'em, and what I want <i>you</i> should
do now is to instruct your representative at Vernis to go round and
hev a talk with that man, and ask him what in thunder he means
by it, and kinder hint that he'll hev the Amurrcan Consul in his hair
pretty smart, if he don't look slippier!</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> <i>mildly suggests that it would be better to communicate
directly with the American Consulate, or with the tradesman himself.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The A. C.</span> But hold on&mdash;how'm I goin' to write to that sharp, when
I've lost his address, and disremember his name? Can't you mail a few
particulars to your agent, so he'll identify him? No? (<i>Disappointed.</i>)
Well, I thought you'd ha' fixed up a little thing like that, anyhow; in my
country they'd ha' done it right away. Yes, <i>Sir</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He goes away in grieved surprise.</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. James Podbury</span>, <i>age twenty-six; in a City Office; short, fresh-coloured,
jaunty; close-cut dark hair. Not having been to the City
to-day, he is wearing light tweeds, and brown boots.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/ill-p3.png" width="421" height="600" alt="Yes, Sir" title="" />
<span class="caption">Yes, Sir</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Just nicked it&mdash;(<i>looks at clock</i>)&mdash;more or less.
And he doesn't seem to have turned up yet. Wonder how we shall hit it
off together. Hughie Rose said he was a capital good chap&mdash;when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
once got over his manner. Anyhow, it's a great tip to go abroad with a
fellow who knows the ropes. (<i>Suddenly sees</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>absorbed in his
note-book</i>.) So <i>here</i> you are, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>slightly scandalized by the tweeds and the brown boots</i>). Yes,
I've been here some little time. I wish you could have managed to come
before, because they close early here to-day, and I wanted to go thoroughly
over the tour I sketched out before getting the tickets.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He produces an elaborate outline.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>easily</i>). Oh, <i>that's</i> all right! I don't care where <i>I</i> go! All I
want is, to see as much as we can in the time&mdash;leave all the rest to you.
I'll sit here while you get the tickets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Old Lady</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span>, <i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is waiting at the counter</i>). Oh,
I <i>beg</i> your pardon, but <i>could</i> you inform me if the 1·55 train from Calais to
Basle stops long enough for refreshments anywhere, and where they
examine the luggage, and if I can leave my hand-bag in the carriage, and
whether there is an English service at Yodeldorf, and is it held in the
hotel, and Evangelical, or High Church, and are the sittings free, and what
Hymn-book they use?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> <i>sets her mind free on as many of these points as he can,
and then attends to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>returning to</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>with two cases bulging with books of
coloured coupons</i>). Here are yours. I should like you to run your eye over
them, and see that they are correct, if you don't mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>stuffing them in his pocket</i>). Can't be bothered now. Take
your word for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> No&mdash;but considering that we start the first thing to-morrow
morning, wouldn't it be as well to have some idea of where you're going?
And, by the way, excuse me, but is it altogether prudent to keep your
tickets in an outside pocket like that? I always keep mine, with my
money, in a special case in an inner pocket, with a buttoned flap&mdash;then I
know I <i>can't</i> lose them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Anything for a quiet life! (<i>He examines his coupons.</i>) Dover
to Ostend? Never been there&mdash;like to see what Ostend's like. But why
didn't you go by Calais?&mdash;<i>shorter</i>, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Because I thought we'd see Bruges and Ghent on our way to
Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Bruges, eh? Capital! Anything particular going on there?
No? It don't matter. And Ghent&mdash;let's see, wasn't that where they
brought the good news from? Yes, we'll stop at Ghent&mdash;if we've time.
Then&mdash;Brussels? Good deal of work to be done there, I suppose, sightseeing,
and that? I like a place where you can moon about without being
bothered myself; now, at <i>Brussels</i>&mdash;never mind, I was only thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It's the best place to get to Cologne and up the Rhine from.
Then, you see, we go rather out of our way to Nuremberg&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Where they make toys? <i>I</i> know&mdash;pretty festive there, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I don't know about festive&mdash;but it is&mdash;er&mdash;a quaint, and
highly interesting old place. Then I thought we'd dip down to Constance,
and strike across the Alps to the Italian Lakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Italian Lakes? First-rate! Yes, <i>they're</i> worth seeing, I suppose.
Think they're better than the <i>Swiss</i> ones, though?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>tolerantly</i>). I can get the coupons changed for Switzerland
if you prefer it. The Swiss Lakes may be the more picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Yes, we'll do Switzerland&mdash;and run back by Paris, eh? Not
much to do in Switzerland, though, after all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a faintly superior smile</i>). There are one or two mountains,
I believe. But, personally, I should prefer Italy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So should I. No fun in mountains&mdash;unless you go up 'em.
What do you think of choosing some quiet place, where nobody ever goes&mdash;say
in France or Germany&mdash;and, sticking to <i>that</i>. More of a rest,
wouldn't it be? such a bore having to know a lot of people!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I don't see how we can change <i>all</i> the tickets, really. If
you like, we could stop a week at St. Goarshausen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> What's St. Goarshausen like&mdash;cheery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I understood the idea was to keep away from our fellow
countrymen, and as far as I can remember St. Goarshausen, it is not overrun
with tourists&mdash;we should be quiet enough <i>there</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> That's the place for <i>me</i>, then. Or could we push on to Vienna?
Never seen Vienna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If you like to give up Italy altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> What do you say to <i>beginning</i> with Italy and working back?
Too hot, eh? Well, then, we'll let things be as they are&mdash;I dare say it will
do well enough. So <i>that's</i> settled!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself on parting, after final arrangements concluded</i>). I
wish Rose had warned me that Podbury's habit of mind was so painfully
desultory. (<i>He sighs.</i>) However&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Wonder how long I shall take to get over
Culchard's manner. (<i>He sighs.</i>) I wish old Hughie was coming&mdash;he'd
give me a leg over!      [<i>He walks on thoughtfully.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><i>Podbury picks up Acquaintances.</i></h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Courtyard of the "Grand Hôtel du Lion Belgique et d'Albion,"
at Brussels. It is just after table d'hôte</i>; <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>
<i>are sitting on a covered terrace, with coffee.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury</span> (<i>producing a pipe</i>). Not such a bad dinner! Expect they'll
rook us a lot for it, though. Rather fun, seeing the waiters all troop in
with a fresh course, when the proprietor rang his bell. Like a ballet at
the Empire&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>selecting a cigarette</i>). I'm not in a position to say. I
don't affect those places of entertainment myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh! Where <i>do</i> you turn in when you want to kick up your
heels a bit? Madame Tussaud's? I say, why on earth didn't you talk
to that old Johnny next to you at dinner? He was trying all he knew
to be friendly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Was he? I dare say. But I rather understood we came out
with the idea of keeping out of all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Of course. <i>I'm</i> not keen about getting to know people. He
had no end of a pretty daughter, though. Mean to say you didn't
spot her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If by "spotting" you mean&mdash;was I aware of the existence
of a very exuberant young person, with a most distressing American
accent?&mdash;I can only say that she made her presence sufficiently evident.
I confess she did not interest me to the point of speculating upon her
relationship to anybody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well&mdash;if you come to that, I don't know that I&mdash;still, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
uncommonly&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Happens to glance round, and lowers his voice.</i>) Jove!
she's in the Reading-room, just behind us. (<i>Hums, with elaborate carelessness.</i>)
La di deedle-lumpty&mdash;loodle-oodle-loo&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who detests humming</i>). By the way, I wish you hadn't been
in such a hurry to come straight on. I particularly wished to stop at
Bruges, and see the Memlings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I do like that! For a fellow who means to keep out of
people's way! They'd have wanted you to stay to lunch and dinner,
most likely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>raising his eyebrows</i>). Hardly, my dear fellow&mdash;they're
pictures, as it happens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>unabashed</i>). Oh, are they? Any way, you've fetched up
your average here. Weren't there enough in the Museum for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>pityingly</i>). You surely wouldn't call the collection here
exactly representative of the best period of Flemish Art?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> If you ask me, I should call it a simply footling show&mdash;but
you were long enough over it. (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>shudders slightly, and
presently pats his pockets.</i>) What's up now? Nothing gone wrong with
the works, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). No&mdash;I was merely feeling for my note-book.
I had a sudden idea for a sonnet, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Ah, you shouldn't have touched those mussels they gave us
with the sole. Have a nip of this cognac, and you'll soon be all right.</p>

St. Gudule in the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Something <i>like</i> a rollick that! But what do you say to

already. Been runnin' all over Scotland and England, and kind of looked
round Ireland and Wales, and now what <i>we've</i> got to do is to see as much
as we can of Germany and Switzerland and It'ly, and get some idea of
France before we start home this fall. I guess we're both of us gettin'
pretty considerable homesick already. My darter was sayin' to me
on'y this evening at <i>table d'hôte</i>, "Father," she sez, "the vurry first thing

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>Podbury is unpleasantly Surprised.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Wiertz Museum at Brussels, a large and well-lighted gallery
containing the works of the celebrated Belgian, which are reducing a
limited number of spectators to the usual degree of stupefaction. Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who seats himself on a central ottoman</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). If Podbury won't come down to breakfast at a
decent hour, he can't complain if I&mdash;&mdash;I wonder if he heard Miss Trotter
say she was thinking of coming here this morning. Somehow, I <i>should</i>
like that girl to have a more correct comprehension of my character. I
don't so much mind her thinking me fastidious and exclusive. I dare say I
<i>am</i>&mdash;but I <i>do</i> object to being made out a hopeless melancholiac! (<i>He
looks round the walls.</i>) So these are Wiertz's masterpieces, eh? h'm.
Strenuous, vigorous,&mdash;a trifle crude, perhaps. Didn't he refuse all offers
for his pictures during his lifetime? Hardly think he could have been
overwhelmed with applications for the one opposite. (<i>He regards an
enormous canvas, representing a brawny and gigantic Achilles perforating a
brown Trojan with a small mast.</i>) Not a dining-room picture. Still, I
like his independence&mdash;work up rather well in a sonnet. Let me see.
(<i>He takes out note-book and scribbles.</i>) "He scorned to ply his sombre
brush for hire." Now if I read that to Podbury, he'd pretend to think I
was treating of a shoe-black on strike! Podbury is so utterly deficient
in reverence.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Close by is a party of three Tourists&mdash;a Father and Mother, and a
Daughter; who is reading to them aloud from the somewhat
effusive Official Catalogue; the education of all three appears
to have been elementary.</i></p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter</span> <i>(spelling out the words laboriously).</i> "I could not
'elp fancying this was the artist's por-portrait?&mdash;portent?&mdash;no, <i>protest</i>
against des-des&mdash;(<i>recklessly</i>) despoticism, and tyranny, but I see it is
only&mdash;Por-Porliffymus fasting upon the companions of Ulyces."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her Male Parent.</span> Do it tell yer what that there big arm and leg
be a-doin' of in the middle of 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daughter</span> (<i>stolidly</i>). Don't you be in a nurry, father (<i>continuing</i>)&mdash;"in
the midst of some colonial?&mdash;<i>That</i> ain't it&mdash;<i>colossial</i> animiles fanatically&mdash;fan-tasty-cally&mdash;&mdash;"why,
this catalogue is 'alf foreign itself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Female P.</span> Never mind, say 'Peterborough' at the 'ard words&mdash;<i>we</i>
shan't be none the wiser!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daughter.</span> "The sime-boalic ram the 'ero is to Peterborough
and leave 'is Peterborough grotter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Male P.</span> That'll do&mdash;read what it says about the next one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daughter</span> (<i>reading</i>). "The Forge of Vulkin. Words are useless 'ere.
Before sech a picture one can but look, and think, and enjoy it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both Parents</span> (<i>impressed</i>). Lor!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>They smack their lips reverently</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> <i>enters the Gallery</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>rising and going to meet her</i>). Good morning, Miss Trotter.
We&mdash;ah&mdash;meet again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> That's an undeniable fact. I've left Poppa outside. Poppa
restricts himself to exteriors wherever he can&mdash;says he doesn't seem to
mix up his impressions so much that way. But you're alone, too. Where've
you hitched your friend up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> My friend did not rise sufficiently early to accompany me.
And, by the way, Miss Trotter, I should like to take this opportunity
of disabusing your mind of the&mdash;er&mdash;totally false impression&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Oh, <i>that's</i> all right. I told him he needn't try to give me
away, for I could see you weren't <i>that</i> kind of man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>gratefully</i>). Your instinct was correct&mdash;perfectly correct.
When you say "that kind of man," I presume you refer to the description
my&mdash;er&mdash;friend considered it humorous to give of me as an unsociable
hypochondriac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, no; he didn't say just that. He represented you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
one of the fonniest persons alive; said you told stories which tickled folks
to death almost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). Really, this is <i>most</i> unpardonable of Mr. Podbury!
To have such odious calumnies circulated about one behind one's
back is simply too&mdash;&mdash;I do <i>not</i> aspire to&mdash;ah&mdash;to tickle folks to death!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>soothingly</i>). Well, I guess there's no harm done. I didn't
feel like being in any imminent danger of perishing that way in your
society. You're real high-toned and ever so improving, and that's better
than tickling, every time. And I want you to show me round this collection
and give me a few notions. Seems to me there was considerable sand
in Wiertz; sort of spread himself around a good deal, didn't he? I presume,
though, he slept bad, nights. (<i>She makes the tour of the Gallery,
accompanied by</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who admires her, against his better judgment,
more and more</i>.) ... I declare if that isn't your friend Mr. Podbury just
come in! I believe I'll have to give you up to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). I beg you will not think it necessary. He&mdash;he
has a guide already. <i>He</i> does not require my services. And, to be plain,
my poor friend&mdash;though an excellent fellow according to his&mdash;ah&mdash;lights&mdash;is
a companion whose society occasionally amounts to a positive infliction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I find him too chinny myself, times. Likely he won't
notice us if we don't seem to be aware of him.</p>

Here, hold on a minute. (<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>followed by</i><span class="smcap"> Guide</span>.)
How d' ye do, Miss Trotter? Doing the Wild Wiertz Show, I see.
Ah, Culchard, why didn't you tell me you were going&mdash;might have
gone together. I say, I've got a guide here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>drily</i>). So we perceive&mdash;a very sensible plan, no doubt, in
some cases, my dear fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span>). Do come and listen to him, most intelligent
chap&mdash;great fun. Mr. Culchard is above that sort of thing, I dare say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You're vurry obliging, Mr. Podbury, but your friend is
explaining it all just splendidly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>piqued</i>). Perhaps I had better dismiss my chap, and take
on Mr. Culchard too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> No, I'd just hate to have you do that. Keep on going
round. You mustn't mind us, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, if you'd rather! (<i>Gloomily, to</i> <span class="smcap">Guide</span>.) They can do
without <i>us</i>. Just show me something more in the blood-and-thunder

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Time <i>I</i> had a look in, I think. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Well, Miss Trotter, what do you think of the Rhine, as far as
you've got?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I guess it's navigable, as far as <i>I've</i> got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> No, but I mean to say&mdash;does it come up to the mark in the
scenery line, you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I cannt answer that till I know whereabouts it is they mark
the scenery-line. I expect Mr. Culchard knows. He knows pretty
well everything. Would you like to have him explain the scenery to you
going along? His explanations are vurry improving, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I dare say; but the scenery just here is so flat that even my
friend's remarks won't improve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>producing his note-book ostentatiously</i>). I do not propose
to attempt it. No doubt you will be more successful in entertaining Miss
Trotter than I can pretend to be. I retire in your favour.      [<i>He scribbles.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Is that our expenses you're corking down there, Culchard, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). If you want to know, I am "corking down,"
to adopt your elegant expression, a sonnet that suggested itself to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Much better cork that <i>up</i>, old chap&mdash;hadn't he, Miss Trotter?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He glances at her for appreciation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> That's so. I don't believe the poetic spirit has much chance
of slopping over so long as Mr. Podbury is around. You have considerable
merit as a stopper, Mr. Podbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I see; I'd better clear out till the poetry has all gurgled out
of him, eh? Is that the idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> If it is, it's your own, so I guess it's a pretty good one.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>shoulders off.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with his pathetic stop on</i>). I wish I had more of your divine
patience! Poor fellow, he is not without his good points; but I do find
him a thorn in my flesh occasionally, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I don't know as a thorn in the flesh is any the
pleasanter for having a good point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Profoundly true, indeed. I often think I could like him
better if there were less in him to like. I assure you he tries me so at
times that I could almost wish I was back at work in my department
at Somerset House!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I dare say you have pretty good times there, too. Isn't that
one of your leading dry goods stores?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>pained</i>). It is not; it is a Government Office, and I am
in the Pigeonhole and Docket Department, with important duties to
discharge. I hope you didn't imagine I sold ribbons and calico over a
counter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>ambiguously</i>). Well, I wasn't just sure. It takes a pretty
bright man to do that where I come from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Old Lady</span> (<i>who is sitting next to</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>, <i>and reading a homeletter

Madeline's frame is expected down next Saturday."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Old Lady.</span> Madeline's frame! Is anything wrong with

all&mdash;oh, <i>married</i>, to be sure), "very slowly" (is it slowly or shortly, I
wonder?), um, um, "very quiet wedding, nobody but dear Mr. Wilkinson
and his hatter."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second O. L.</span> The idea of choosing one's hatter for one's best man!
I'm surprised Maria should allow it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First O. L.</span> Maria always <i>was</i> peculiar&mdash;still, now I come to look,
it's more like "brother," which is certainly <i>much</i> more suitable. (<i>Continuing.</i>)
"She will have no&mdash;no bird's-marks ..." (Now, what <i>does</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that&mdash;should you think that meant "crows-feet"? Oh, no, <i>how</i> stupid
of me&mdash;<i>bridesmaids</i>, of course!)&mdash;"and will go to the otter a plain guy"&mdash;(Oh,
Caroline really is <i>too</i> ...)&mdash;"to the <i>altar</i> in plain <i>grey</i>! She

putting it, I <i>must</i> say! It's meant for <i>honeymoon</i>, though, I see, to be
<i>sure</i>!) &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span>). I should like to be at Nuremberg with you.
It would be an unspeakable delight to watch the expansion of a fresh
young soul in that rich mediæval atmosphere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess you'll have opportunities of watching Mr. Podbury's
fresh young soul under those conditions, any way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It would not be at all the same thing&mdash;even if he&mdash;but you
<i>do</i> think you're coming to Nuremberg, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, it's this way. Poppa don't want to get fooling around
any more one-horse towns than he can help, and he's got to be fixed up
with the idea that Nuremberg is a prominent European sight before he
drops everything to get there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I will undertake to interest him in Nuremberg. Fortunately,
we are all getting off at Bingen, and going, curiously enough, to the same
hotel. (<i>To himself.</i>) Confound that fellow Podbury, here he is <i>again</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to himself, as he advances</i>). If she's carrying on with that
fellow, Culchard, to provoke me, I'll soon show her how little I&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
I say, old man, hope I'm not interrupting you, but I just want
to speak to you for a minute, if Miss Trotter will excuse us. Is there
any particular point in going as far as Bingen to-night, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>resignedly</i>). As much as there is in not going farther than
somewhere else, <i>I</i> should have thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well, but look here&mdash;why not stop at Bacharach, and see what
sort of a place it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You forget that our time is limited if we're going to stick
to our original route.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Yes, of course; mustn't waste any on the Rhine. Suppose we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
push on to Maintz to-night, and get the Rhine off our hands then? (<i>With
a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span>.) The sooner I've done with this steamer
business the better!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, Mr. Podbury, that's not a vurry complimentary
remark to make before me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> We've seen so little of one another lately that it can hardly
make much difference&mdash;to <i>either</i> of us&mdash;can it?</p>

Podbury?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). Neither, as it happens. I'm for Bingen, too, as you
won't go anywhere else. Though you <i>did</i> say when we started, that the
advantage of travelling like this was that we could go on or stop just as
the fancy took us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>calmly</i>). I did, my dear Podbury. But it never occurred
to me that the fancy would take you to get tired of a place before you got
there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>as he walks forwards</i>). Hang that fellow! I know I shall
punch his head some day. And She didn't seem to care whether I stayed
or not. (<i>Hopefully.</i>) But you never <i>can</i> tell with women!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>Culchard makes a little Miscalculation.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Garden of the Hotel Victoria at Bingen, commanding a view of the
Rhine and the vine-terraced hills, which are bathed in warm afternoon
sunlight. Under the mopheaded acacias</i>, <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>are
sitting smoking. At a little distance from them, are a Young Married
Couple, whose honeymoon is apparently in its last quarter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bridegroom</span> (<i>lazily, to Bride, as she draws another chair towards
her for a foot-rest</i>). How many <i>more</i> chairs do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bride</span> (<i>without looking at him</i>). I should think you could spare me
one&mdash;you can hardly sit on three at once!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>After this interchange of amenities, they consider themselves absolved
from any further conversational efforts.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culch.</span>, <i>resuming a discussion</i>). I know as well as you do
that we are booked for Nuremberg; but what <i>I</i> say is&mdash;that's no earthly
reason why we should <i>go</i> there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> No reason why <i>you</i> should go, unless you wish it, certainly.
<i>I</i> intend to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well, it's beastly selfish, that's all! I know <i>why</i> you're so
keen about it, too. Because the Trotters are going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>colouring</i>). That's an entire mistake on your part. Miss
Trotter has nothing to do with it. I don't even know whether she's
going or not&mdash;for certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> No, but you've a pretty good idea that she <i>is</i>, though. And I
<i>know</i> how it will be. You'll be going about with her all the time, and I
shall be shunted on to the old man! I don't <i>see</i> it, you know! (<span class="smcap">Culch.</span>
<i>remains silent. A pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>suddenly begins to search his pockets.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
I say&mdash;here's a pretty fix! Look here, old fellow, doosid annoying thing,
but I can't find my purse&mdash;must have lost it somewhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>stoically</i>). I can't say I'm surprised to hear it. It's awkward,
certainly. I suppose I shall have to lend you enough to go home with&mdash;it's
all I can do; but I'll do that with&mdash;er&mdash;pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>staring</i>). Go home? Why, I can wire to the governor for
more, easily enough. We shall have to stay here till it comes, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> And give up Nuremberg? Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I rather like this place, you know&mdash;sort of rest. And we could
always nip over to Ems, or Homburg, if it got too slow, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I nip over anywhere, I shall nip to Nuremberg. We may
just as well understand one another, Podbury. If I'm to provide money
for both of us, it's only reasonable that you should be content to go where
<i>I</i> choose. I cannot, and will not, stand these perpetual interferences with
our original plan; it's sheer restlessness. Come with me to Nuremberg,
and I shall be very happy to be your banker. Otherwise, you must stay
here alone.         [<i>He compresses his lips and crosses his legs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, <i>that's</i> it, is it? But look here, why not tit up whether we
go on or stay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Why should I "tit up," as you call it, when I've already made
up my mind to go? When I once decide on anything, it's final.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bride</span> (<i>to Bridegroom, without enthusiasm</i>). Would you like me
to roll you a cigarette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridegroom</span> (<i>with the frankness of an open nature</i>). Not if I know it.
I can do it better myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bride</span> (<i>coldly</i>). I see.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Another silence, at the end of which she rises and walks slowly
away, pausing at the gate to see whether he intends to follow.
As he does not appear to have remarked her absence, she
walks on.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culch.</span>, <i>in an undertone</i>). I say, those two don't seem to hit
it off exactly, eh? Seem sorry they came! You'll be glad to hear, old
fellow, that we needn't separate after all. Just found my purse in my
trouser-pocket!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Better luck than you deserve. Didn't I tell you you should
have a special pocket for your money and coupons? Like this&mdash;see. (<i>He
opens his coat</i>) With a buttoned flap, it stands to reason they <i>must</i> be
safe!</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;GOOD HEAVENS, IT&mdash;IT&#39;S GONE!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So long as you keep it buttoned, old chap,&mdash;which you don't
seem to do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). Pshaw! The button is a trifle too&mdash;(<i>feels pocket,
and turns pale</i>). Good Heavens, it&mdash;it's <i>gone</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> The button?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>patting himself all over with shaking hands</i>). Everything!&mdash;money,
coupons, circular notes! They&mdash;they must have fallen out going
up that infernal Niederwald. (<i>Angrily.</i>) You <i>would</i> insist on going!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Phew! The whole bag of tricks gone! You're lucky if you
get them again. Any number of tramps and beggars all the way up.
Shouldn't have taken off your coat&mdash;very careless of you! (<i>He grins.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It was so hot. I must go and inform the Police here&mdash;I may
recover it yet. Anyway, we&mdash;we must push on to Nuremberg, and I'll
telegraph home for money to be sent here. You can let me have enough
to get on with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> With all the pleasure in life, dear boy&mdash;on your own conditions,
you know. I mean, if I pay the piper, I call the tune. Now, I don't
cotton to Nuremberg somehow; I'd rather go straight on to Constance;
we could get some rowing there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>pettishly</i>). Rowing be&mdash;&mdash;(<i>recollecting his helplessness</i>). No;
but just consider, my dear Podbury. I assure you you'll find Nuremberg
a most delightful old place. You must see how bent I am on going there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, yes, I see <i>that</i>. But then I'm <i>not</i>, don't you know&mdash;so
there we are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>desperately</i>). Well, I'll&mdash;I'll meet you half-way. I've no
objection to&mdash;er&mdash;titting up with you&mdash;Nuremberg or Constance. Come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> You weren't so anxious to tit up just now&mdash;but never mind.
(<i>Producing a mark.</i>) Now then, Emperor&mdash;Constance. Eagle&mdash;Nuremberg.
Is it sudden death, or best out of three?       [<i>He tosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Sud&mdash;­&mdash; (<i>The coin falls with the Emperor uppermost.</i>) Best
out of three.         [<i>He takes coin from</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>and tosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Eagle! we're even so far. (<i>He receives coin.</i>) This settles it.      [<i>He tosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>). Eagle again! Now mind, Podbury, no going
back after <i>this</i>. It must <i>be</i> Nuremberg now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> All right! And now allow me to have the pleasure of restoring
your pocket-book and note-case. They did fall out on the Niederwald,
and it was a good job for you I was behind and saw them drop. You
must really be careful, dear boy. Ain't you going to say "ta" for them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>relieved</i>). I'm&mdash;er&mdash;tremendously obliged. I really can't say
how.&mdash;(<i>Recollecting himself.</i>) But you need not have taken advantage of it
to try to do me out of going to Nuremberg&mdash;it was a shabby trick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, it was only to get a rise out of you. I never meant to
keep you to it, of course. And I say, weren't you sold, though? Didn't I
lead up to it beautifully? (<i>He chuckles.</i>) Score to me, eh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with amiable sententiousness</i>). Ah, well, I don't grudge you
your little joke if it amuses you. Those laugh best who laugh last. And
it's settled now that we're going to Nuremberg.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> <i>and her father have come out from the Speisesaal
doors, and overhear the last speech.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trotter</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>). Your friend been gettin' off a joke on
you, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Only in his own estimation, Mr. Trotter. I have nailed him
down to going to Nuremberg, which, for many reasons, I was extremely
anxious to visit. (<i>Carelessly.</i>) Are we likely to be there when you are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess not. We've just got our mail, and my cousin, Charley
Van Boodeler, writes he's having a real lovely time in the Engadine&mdash;says
it's the most elegant locality he's struck yet, and just as full of Amurrcans
as it can hold; so we're going to start out there right away. I don't
believe we shall have time for Nuremberg this trip. Father, if we're going
to see about checking the baggage through, we'd better go down to the
<i>depôt</i> right now.           [<i>They pass on.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a very blank face and a feeble whistle</i>). Few-fitty-fitty-fitty-fa-di-fee-fee-foo;
few&mdash;&mdash;After all, Podbury, I don't know that I
care so much about Nuremberg. They&mdash;they say it's a good deal changed
from what it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So are <i>you</i>, old chap, if it comes to that. Tiddledy-iddlety-ido-lumpty-doodle-oo!
Is it to be Constance after all, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>reddening</i>). Er&mdash;I rather thought of the Engadine&mdash;more
<i>bracing</i>, eh?&mdash;few-feedle-eedle-oodle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> You artful old whistling oyster, <i>I</i> see what you're up to! But
it's no go; she don't want either of us Engadining about after her. It's
Charley Van Stickinthemud's turn now! We've got to go to Nuremberg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
You can't get out of it, after gassing so much about the place. When
you've once decided, you know, it's <i>final</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). I am not aware that I <i>wanted</i> to get out of it.
I merely proposed in your&mdash;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>suddenly explodes</i>.) What are
you cackling at <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>wiping his eyes</i>). It's the last laugh, old man,&mdash;and it's the
best!</p>

<h3>A Dissolution of Partnership.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Second-Class Compartment on the line between Wurzburg and
Nuremberg.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>has been dull and depressed all day, not having
recovered from the parting with</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span>. <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>on
the contrary, is almost ostentatiously cheerful.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>is intensely
anxious to find out how far his spirits are genuine, but&mdash;partly from shyness,
and partly because some of their fellow travellers have been English&mdash;he

alone, and he is determined to have it out on the very first opportunity.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard.</span> Abominably slow train, this <i>Schnell-zug</i>. I hope we
shall get to Nuremberg before it's too dark to see the general effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury.</span> We're not likely to be in time for <i>table d'hôte</i>&mdash;not that
<i>I'm</i> peckish. (<i>He sighs.</i>) Wonder whereabouts the&mdash;the Trotters have

Dum-dum-diddle-um-tum-dum-dum-dum-ty-doodle; dum-dum&mdash;I say,

<p><span class="smcap">Second T. T.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). I mean to say, they don't 'ave nothing
to indicate which is Jack's property, and which is Joe's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First T. T.</span> Go on&mdash;they've as much as what <i>we</i> 'ave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second T. T.</span> <i>'Ave</i> they? We 'ave fences and 'edges. I don't see

thoroughly.</p>

Look here, old fellow, I don't mind owning <i>I'm</i> rather down in the mouth

chance of our coming across them again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I?&mdash;is it <i>likely</i>! I&mdash;I admire her awfully, you know, only
she rather seemed to snub me lately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with patronising reassurance</i>). Quite a mistake on your
part, I assure you, my dear fellow. I am sure she will learn to
appreciate you&mdash;er&mdash;fully when you meet again, which, I may tell you,
will be at no very distant date. I happen to know that she will be
at the Italian Lakes next month, and so shall we, if you let me manage
this tour my own way.</p>

you were such a nailing good chap? Nein, danky. (<i>To the little Cripple,

Cheeky little beggar. But do you really think anything will&mdash;er&mdash;come
of it, if we do meet her again&mdash;<i>do</i> you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I put that to her, and there is nothing in it. In fact, she
practically admitted&mdash;(<i>He glances round and lowers his voice.</i>) I will
tell you another time. That lady over there is looking at us, and I'm
almost certain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> What if she is, she don't understand a word we're saying.
I want to hear all about Her, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> My dear Podbury, we shall have ample time to talk about
her while we are at Nuremberg together&mdash;it will be the greatest pleasure
to me to do so as long as you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Thanks, old chap! I'd no idea you were doing all this, you
know. But just tell me this, what did she <i>say</i> about me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>mystified</i>). About you? I really don't recollect that she
mentioned <i>you</i> particularly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). But I thought you said you'd been speaking up for
me! What <i>did</i> you talk about then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, about myself&mdash;naturally.</p>

<blockquote>[<i>He settles his collar with a vague satisfaction.</i></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>blankly</i>). Oh! Then you haven't been arranging to meet
her again on <i>my</i> account?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Good Heavens, no&mdash;what a very grotesque idea of yours,
my dear fellow!               [<i>He laughs gently.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Is it? You always gave out that she wasn't your style at all,
and you only regarded her as a "study," and rot like that. How could
<i>I</i> tell you would go and cut me out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I don't deny that she occasionally&mdash;er&mdash;jarred. She is a
little deficient in surface refinement&mdash;but that will come, that will come.
And as to "cutting you out," why, you must allow you never had the
remotest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I don't allow anything of the sort. She liked me well enough
till&mdash;till you came in and set her against me, and you may think it
friendly if you like, but I call it shabby&mdash;confoundedly shabby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Don't talk so loud, I'm sure I saw that woman smile!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> She may smile her head off for all I care. (<i>The train stops;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><i>the Cripple and all but the</i> Pale-haired Lady <i>get out.</i>) Here we are at

<blockquote>[<i>He gets his coat and stick, &amp;c., out of the rack.</i></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Because I shall go to some other, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>in dismay</i>). My dear Podbury, this is really too childish!
There's no sense in travelling together, if we're going to stay at different
hotels!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I'm not sure I shall go any further. Anyway, while I <i>am</i> here,
I prefer to keep to myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a displeased laugh</i>). Just as you please. It's a matter
of perfect indifference to <i>me</i>. I'm afraid you'll be terribly bored by
yourself, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> That's <i>my</i> look out. It can't be worse than going about
with you and listening while you crow and drivel about <i>her</i>, that's
one comfort!      [<i>The</i> Pale-haired Lady <i>coughs in a suspicious manner.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You don't even know if there <i>is</i> another hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I don't care. I can find a pot-house somewhere, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pale-haired Lady</span> (<i>in excellent English, to</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>as he
passes out</i>). Pardon me, you will find close to the Bahnhof a very goot
hotel&mdash;the Wurtemburger.</p>

<blockquote>[<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>thanks her and alights in some confusion; the Lady
sinks back, smiling.</i></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). She must have understood every word we said!
Are you in earnest over this? (<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>nods grimly.</i>) Well, you'll soon
get tired of your own society, I warn you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Thanks, we shall see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>Podbury finds Consolation.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Bridge over the Pegnitz, at Nuremberg. Time, afternoon. The
shadows of the old gabled and balconied houses are thrown sharply on the
reddish-yellow water. Above the steep speckled roofs, the spires of St.
Lorenz glitter against the blue sky.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is leaning listlessly
upon the parapet of the bridge.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>to himself</i>). How mediæval it all is, and how infinitely
restful! (<i>He yawns.</i>) What a blessed relief to be without that fellow
Podbury! He's very careful to keep out of my way&mdash;I've scarcely seen
him since I've been here. He must find it dreadfully dull. (<i>He sighs.</i>) I
ought to find material for a colour-sonnet here, with these subdued grey
tones, those dull coppery-greens, and the glowing reds of the conical caps
of those towers. I <i>ought</i>&mdash;but I don't. I fancy that half-engagement to
Maud Trotter must have scared away the Muse. I wonder if Podbury
has really gone yet? (<i>Here a thump on the back disposes of any doubt as to
this.</i>) Er&mdash;so you're still at Nuremberg?        [<i>Awkwardly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Rather! Regular ripping old place this&mdash;suits me
down to the ground. And how are <i>you</i> getting on, my bonnie boy, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who does not quite like being addressed as a bonnie boy</i>). Perfectly,
thanks. My mind is being&mdash;er&mdash;stimulated here in the direction
most congenial to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So's mine. By the way, have you got a book&mdash;I don't mean a
novel, but a regular improving book&mdash;the stodgier the better&mdash;to lend a
fellow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, I brought an <i>Epitome of Herbert Spencer's Synthetic</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i>Philosophy</i> away with me to dip into occasionally. It seems a very able
summary, and you are welcome to it, if it's of any use to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Spencer, eh?&mdash;he's a stiff kind of old bird, ain't he? He'll do
me to-rights, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It strikes me, Podbury, that you must find the time rather
long, to want a book of that kind. If you wish to resume our&mdash;ah&mdash;original
relations, I am quite ready to overlook what I am sure was only a
phase of not unnatural disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Oh, <i>that's</i> all right, old fellow. I've got over
all that business. (<i>He colours slightly.</i>) How soon did you think of
moving on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>briskly</i>). As soon as you please. We might start for
Constance to-morrow, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well, you see, it's just this: there's a fellow staying
at my hotel&mdash;Prendergast, his name is&mdash;rattling good sort&mdash;and I've rather
chummed up with him, and&mdash;and he's travelling with a relation of his,
and&mdash;well, the fact is, they rather made a point of my going on to
Constance with <i>them</i>, don't you see? But I daresay we could work it
so as to go on all together. I'll see what they say about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). I'm exceedingly obliged&mdash;but so large a party is
scarcely&mdash;however, I'll let you know whether I can join you or not this
evening. Are you&mdash;er&mdash;going anywhere in particular just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well, yes. I've got to meet Prendergast at the <i>Café Noris</i>.
We're going to beat up some stables, and see if we can't hire a couple
of gees for an hour or two before dinner. Do you feel inclined for a
tittup?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Thanks, but I am no equestrian. (<i>To himself, after</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury's</span>
<i>departure.</i>) He seems to manage well enough without me. And
yet I do think my society would be more good for him than&mdash;&mdash;. Why
did he want to borrow that book, though? Can my influence after
all&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He walks on thoughtfully, till he finds himself before an optician's
window in which a mechanical monkey is looking through a miniature
telescope; the monkey suddenly turns its head and gibbers at him. This
familiarity depresses him, and he moves away, feeling lonelier than ever.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">ON THE TERRACE OF THE BURG. HALF AN HOUR LATER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>on a seat commanding a panorama of roofs, gables, turrets, and
spires</i>). Now this is a thing that can only be properly enjoyed when one
is by oneself. The mere presence of Podbury&mdash;well, thank goodness, he's
found more congenial company. (<i>He sighs.</i>) That looks like an English
girl sketching on the next seat. Rather a fine profile, so regular&mdash;general
air of repose about her. Singular, now I think of it, how little repose
there is about Maud. (<i>The</i> Young Lady <i>rises and walks to the parapet.</i>)
Dear me, she has left her india-rubber behind her. I really think I
ought&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He rescues the india-rubber, which he restores to the owner.</i>)
Am I mistaken in supposing that this piece of india-rubber is your
property?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> (<i>in musically precise tones</i>). Your supposition is perfectly
correct. I was under the impression that it would be safe where it was for
a few moments; but I am obliged to you, nevertheless. I find india-rubber
quite indispensable in sketching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I can quite understand that. I&mdash;I mean that it reduces the&mdash;er&mdash;paralysing
sense of irrevocability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> You express my own meaning exactly.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>not being quite sure of his own, is proportionately
pleased.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You have chosen an inspiring scene, rich with historical
interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Yes, indeed. What names rise to one's
mind instinctively! Melanchthon, John Huss, Kraft, and Peter Vischer, and
Dürer, and Wohlgemut, and Maximilian the First, and Louis of Bavaria!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who has read up the local history, and does not intend to be
beaten at this game</i>). Precisely. And the imperious Margrave of Brandenburg,
and Wallenstein, and Gustavus Adolphus, and Goetz von
Berlichingen. One can almost see their&mdash;er&mdash;picturesque personalities
still haunting the narrow streets as we look down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> I find it impossible to distinguish even the streets from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
here, I confess, but you probably see with the imagination of an artist.

<span class="caption">&quot;ER&mdash;I HAVE BROUGHT YOU THE PHILOSOPHICAL WORK I MENTIONED.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Only in words; that is, I record my impressions in a poetic
form. A perfect sonnet may render a scene, a mood, a passing thought,
more indelibly than the most finished sketch; may it not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> That is quite true; indeed, I occasionally relieve my
feelings by the composition of Greek or Latin verses, which I find, on the
whole, better adapted to express the subtler emotions. Don't you agree
with me there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who has done no Greek or Latin verse since he left school</i>).
Doubtless. But I am hindering your sketch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Y. L.</span> No, I was merely saturating my mind with the general
effect. I shall not really begin my sketch till to-morrow. I am going
now. I hope the genius of the place will inspire you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Thank you. I trust it will&mdash;er&mdash;have that effect. (<i>To
himself after the</i> Young Lady <i>has left the terrace.</i>) Now, that's a very
superior girl&mdash;she has intellect, style, culture&mdash;everything the ideal woman
<i>should</i> have. I wonder, now, whether, if I had met her before&mdash;but such
speculations are most unprofitable! How clear her eyes looked through
her <i>pince-nez</i>! Blue-grey, like Athene's own. If I'd been with Podbury,
I should never have had this talk. The sight of him would have repelled
her at once. I shall tell him when I take him that book that he had
better go his own way with his new friends. I like the view from
this terrace&mdash;I shall come up here again&mdash;often.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Conversations-Saal at the Wurtemburger-Hof. Evening.</i>

mentioned. I will leave it for an occasion when you are&mdash;er&mdash;in a fitter
frame of mind for its perusal.</p>

The moral is&mdash;Now <i>don't</i> you come from Fla-an-ders,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>Culchard is rather too Clever.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Burg Terrace at Nuremberg.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>on a bench, grappling
with the "Epitome of Spencer."</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>reading aloud, with comments</i>). "For really to conceive the
infinite divisibility of matter is mentally to follow out the divisions to
infinity, and to do this would require infinite time." You're right <i>there</i>,
old cock, and, as I haven't got it to spare, I won't trouble you!&mdash;um&mdash;um
... "opposite absurdities"&mdash;"subjective modifications" ... "ultimate
scientific ideas, then, are all representative of ideas that cannot be comprehended."
I could have told <i>him</i> that. What bally rot this Philosophy
is&mdash;but I suppose I must peg away at it. Didn't she say she was sorry I
didn't go in more for cultivating my mind? (<i>He looks up.</i>) Jove, here she
comes! and yes, there's that beggar Culchard with her! I thought
he'd&mdash;how the dickens did he manage to&mdash;&mdash;? I see what <i>he's</i> after&mdash;thinks
he'll cut me out&mdash;twice over&mdash;but he shan't this time, if I can
help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Hypatia Prendergast</span>). No, the Modern Spirit
is too earnestly intent upon solving the problems of existence to tolerate
humour in its literature. Humour has served a certain purpose in its day,
but that day is done, and I for one cannot pretend to regret its decay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss H. P.</span> Nor I. In fact, the only humour I ever <i>really</i> appreciated
is that of the ancient classics. There has been no true fun since Aristophanes
died. At least, <i>I</i> think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>catching the last sentence</i>). Oh, I say, come, Miss Prendergast.
Have you ever read <i>The Jumping Frog</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I was under the impression that <i>all</i> frogs jumped. But I
never read&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>study</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>declining to be crushed</i>). Well, I call Mark Twain funny anyhow.
But <i>I'm</i> going in for study now. I am&mdash;honour bright! I'm

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> And are you not enchanted by the logical lucidity of that
great thinker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Um&mdash;I should be more enchanted if I ever had the faintest
notion what the great thinker was driving at. Look here&mdash;here's a simple
little sentence for you! (<i>Reads.</i>) "Let us therefore bear in mind the
following:&mdash;That of the whole incident force affecting an aggregate, the
effective force is that which remains after deducting the non-effective, that
the temporarily effective and the permanently effective vary inversely, and
that the molar and molecular changes wrought by the permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
effective force also vary inversely." (<i>With pathos.</i>) And that's only in an
<i>Epitome</i>, mind you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Really, Mr. Podbury, I see nothing particularly incomprehensible
in that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with his superior smile</i>). My dear Podbury, you can hardly
expect to master the Spencerian phraseology and habit of thought without
at least <i>some</i> preliminary mental discipline!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>nettled</i>). Oh&mdash;but <i>you</i> find him plain-sailing enough, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I have certainly not encountered any insuperable difficulties
in his works as <i>yet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well, I'll just trouble you to explain <i>this</i>&mdash;wait a bit. (<i>Opens
volume again.</i>) Ah, here we are&mdash;"And these illusive and primordial
cognitions, or pseud-ideas, are homogeneous entities which may be differentiated
objectively or subjectively, according as they are presented as
Noumenon or Phenomenon. Or, in other words, they are only cognoscible

tell me you can make head or tail of all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>perceiving that</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> <i>is awaiting his reply in manifest suspense</i>).
It's simple enough, my dear fellow, only I can't expect <i>you</i> to
grasp it. It is merely a profound truth stated with masterly precision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, is <i>that</i> all, my dear fellow? (<i>He flings up his heels in an
ecstasy.</i>) I <i>knew</i> I'd have you! Why, I made that up myself as I went

through the&mdash;the "preliminary mental discipline."</p>

childishness of that sort, I can't pretend to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>wiping his eyes</i>). But you <i>did</i> pretend, old chap. You said it
was "profound truth" and "masterly precision"! I've got more profound
truth where <i>that</i> came from. I say, I shall set up as an intellectual Johnny
after this, and get you to write an Epitome of me. I think I pulled your
leg <i>that</i> time, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>biting his lip</i>). When you have extracted sufficient entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>ment

To think of his taking me in with an idiotic trick like that! And before
Her too! And when I had made it all right about the other evening, and

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Afraid she's gone too far&mdash;thinks she'll smooth
me down! Upon my word, it would serve her right to&mdash;but no, I won't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
petty. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Pray tell Miss Prendergast that I have no immediate
intention of altering my position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Thanks awfully, old chap. I knew you'd oblige.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>incisively</i>). I am obliging Miss Prendergast, and her only.
(<i>Raising his voice, without turning his head.</i>) Would you prefer me to <i>face</i>
you, Miss Prendergast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>in tremulous tones</i>). N&mdash;no, thank you. It&mdash;it's so much
more n&mdash;natural, don't you know, for you to be l&mdash;looking at the view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> As you please. (<i>To himself.</i>) Can't meet my eye. Good!
I shall go on treating her distantly for a little. I wonder if I look indifferent
enough from behind? Shall I cross one foot? Better not&mdash;she
may have begun sketching me. If she imagines I'm susceptible to feminine
flattery of this palpable kind, she'll&mdash;&mdash;how her voice shook, though, when
she spoke. Poor girl, she's afraid she offended me by laughing&mdash;and I <i>did</i>
think she had more sense than to&mdash;but I mustn't be too hard on her. I'm
afraid she's already beginning to think too much of&mdash;and with my peculiar
position with Miss Trotter&mdash;(Maud, that is)&mdash;not that there's anything
definite at present, still&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Ahem, Miss Prendergast&mdash;am I
standing as you wish? (<i>To himself.</i>) She doesn't answer&mdash;too absorbed,

gone off in a huff, I expect. So much the better! What a time she is
over this, and how quiet she keeps! I wish I knew whether it was coquetry

she <i>did</i> laugh at me. I distinctly saw her. Still, if she's sorry, this would
be an excellent opportunity for&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) Miss Prendergast! (<i>No reply&mdash;&mdash;louder.</i>)

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>Podbury insists on an Explanation.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A flight of steps by the lake in the grounds of the Insel Hôtel,
Constance. Time, late afternoon. A small boat, containing three
persons, is just visible far out on the glassy grey-green water.</i> <span class="smcap">Bob
Prendergast</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>are perched side by side on a parapet,
smoking disconsolately.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury.</span> Do they look at all as if they meant to come in? I tell
you what, Bob, I vote we row out to them and tell them they'll be late
for <i>table d'hôte</i>. Eh?            [<i>He knocks out his pipe.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prendergast</span> (<i>phlegmatically</i>). Only be late for it ourselves if we
do. They'll come in when they want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> It's not safe for your sister,&mdash;I'm hanged if it is&mdash;going out
in a boat with a duffer like Culchard! He'll upset her as sure as
eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> (<i>with fraternal serenity</i>). With pin-oars? Couldn't if he
tried! And they've a man with them, too. The less I see of that chap
Culchard the better. I did hope we'd choked him off at Nuremberg. I
hate the sight of his supercilious old mug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> You can't hate it more than I do&mdash;but what can I do?
(<i>Pathetically</i>.) I've tried rotting him, but somehow he always manages
to get the best of it in the end. I never saw such a beggar to
hang on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> What on earth made you ask him to come on here, after
he declared he wouldn't?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I! <i>I</i> ask him? He settled it all with your sister. How
could <i>I</i> help it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> I'd do <i>something</i>. Why can't you tell him right out he ain't
wanted? <i>I</i> would&mdash;like a shot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> It's not so easy to tell him as you think. We haven't been
on speaking terms these three days. And, after all (<i>feebly</i>) we're supposed
to be travelling together, don't you know! <i>You</i> might drop him a hint
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> Don't see how I can very well&mdash;not on my own hook.
Might lead to ructions with Hypatia, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). Bob, you&mdash;you don't think your sister really&mdash;&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> Hypatia's a rum girl&mdash;always was. She certainly don't
seem to object to your friend Culchard. What the dickens she can
see in him, I don't know!&mdash;but it's no use my putting <i>my</i> oar in. She'd
only jump on <i>me</i>, y'know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>rising</i>). Then I <i>must</i>. If that's what he's really after, I think
I can stop his little game. I'll try, at any rate. It's a long worm that
has no turning, and I've had about enough of it. The first chance I get,
I'll go for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prend.</span> Good luck to you, old chap. There, they're coming in now.
We'd better go in and change, eh? We've none too much time.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>They go in.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>In the Lese-zimmer, a small gaslit room, with glazed doors opening upon
the Musik-saal. Around a table piled with German and English
periodicals, a mild Curate, the Wife of the English Chaplain, and
two Old Maids are seated, reading and conversing.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is
on a central ottoman, conscientiously deciphering the jokes in "Fliegende
Blätter</i>." <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>is at the bookcase, turning over odd
Tauchnitz volumes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chaplain's Wife</span> (<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Curate</span>, <i>a new arrival</i>). Oh, you will
<i>very</i> soon get into all our little ways. The hours here are <i>most</i> convenient&mdash;breakfast
(<i>table d'hôte</i>) with choice of eggs or fish and coffee&mdash;really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<i>admirable</i> coffee&mdash;from eight to nine; midday dinner at one. Supper at
nine. Then, if you want to write a letter, the post for England goes out&mdash;(<i>&amp;c.,

<p><span class="smcap">First Old Maid</span> (<i>looking up from a four days' old "Telegraph"</i>).
I see they are still continuing that very interesting correspondence on
"Our Children's Mouths&mdash;and are they widening?" One letter attributes
it to the habit of thumb-sucking in infancy&mdash;which certainly ought to
be checked. Now I never <i>would</i> allow any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The C.'s. W.</span> Nor I. But corals are quite as bad. Only this
afternoon I was telling a Lady in this hotel that her little boy would
be much happier with a rubber ring. You get them at a shop in the
Hoch-strasse&mdash;I can take you to it at any time, or if you like to mention
my name&mdash;&mdash;(<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second O. M.</span> One correspondent thought the practice of eating
soup with table-spoons tended to enlarge the mouth. I really believe
there may be something in it.           [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Curate.</span> The weather we have been having seems to have
materially affected the harvest prospects at home; they say there will
be little or no fodder for the cattle this year. I saw somewhere&mdash;I forget
where it was exactly&mdash;a suggestion to feed cows on chickweed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>at the bookcase</i>). Capital thing for them too, Sir. Know
a man who never gives his cattle anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Curate.</span> Oh, really? And does he find the experiment answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> They take to it like birds. And&mdash;curious thing&mdash;after he'd
tried it a month, all the cows turned yellow and went about chirping
and twittering and hopping. Fact, I assure you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Curate.</span> Dear me&mdash;I should scarcely have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He gradually comes to the conclusion that he is being trifled with,
and after a few moments of uncomfortable silence, gets up and
quits the room with dignity.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). <i>One</i> of 'em gone! Now if I can only clear these
old tabbies out, I can tackle Culchard. (<i>Aloud, to</i> <span class="smcap">Chaplain's Wife</span>.)
You don't happen to know if there's a good doctor here, I suppose?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
A lady was saying in the Musik-saal&mdash;the lady with the three daughters

colds or something, and asking who there was to call in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The C.'s W.</span> Oh, I've <i>no</i> belief in foreign doctors. I always find
a few drops of aconite or pulsatilla,&mdash;&mdash;I have my hom&oelig;opathic case with
me now. Perhaps, if I went and had a talk with her I could&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She goes out energetically.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Another gone! (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Old Maids</span>.) So you aren't going
down to the Cloisters to-night? I'm told there's to be some fun there&mdash;Hide-and-seek,
or something&mdash;first-rate place for it, especially now the
moon's up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First O. M.</span> Nobody told <i>us</i> a word about it. Hide-and-seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&mdash;and
in those quaint old Cloisters too&mdash;It sounds delightful! What do
you say, Tabitha. Shall we just&mdash;&mdash;? Only to look <i>on</i>, you know. We
needn't <i>play</i>, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Two Old Maids</span> <i>withdraw in a pleased flutter.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>
<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with determination</i>). Look here, Culchard, I'd just like to know
what you mean by the way you're going on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I thought we were both agreed that discussions of this
kind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> It's all bosh our travelling together if we're not to have any
discussions. You've been on the sulk long enough. And I'll thank you
to inform me what you're after here, going about alone with Miss Prendergast
like this, in the Museum with her all the morning, and on the lake
again this afternoon&mdash;it won't <i>do,</i> you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If she happens to prefer my society to yours and her
brother's, I presume you have no claim to interfere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I don't know about that. How about Miss Trotter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I remember rightly, you yourself were not insensible to
Miss Trotter's&mdash;er&mdash;attractions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Perhaps not; but I am not engaged to her&mdash;you <i>are</i>. You
told me so in the train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You entirely misunderstood me. There was no definite
understanding between us&mdash;nothing of the sort or kind. In fact, it was
merely a passing caprice. Since I have had the privilege of knowing
Miss Prendergast, I see clearly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Then you mean to propose to her, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> That is certainly my intention; have you any objection to
offer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Only that I mean to propose too. I dare say my chances are
as good as yours&mdash;even now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I doubt it, my dear fellow; however, don't let <i>me</i> discourage
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I don't intend to. (<i>The figure of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> <i>is seen
to pass the glazed doors, and move slowly across the Musik-saal; both rush</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<i>to the door, and look after her.</i>) She's gone out into the balcony. 'Jove,
I'll go too, and get it over!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I should not advise you to do so. It is possible she may
have gone there with the&mdash;er&mdash;expectation of being joined by&mdash;by
somebody else.               [<i>He smiles complacently.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> You mean she gave you a <i>rendezvous</i> there? I don't believe
it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I did not say so. But I am not prepared to deny that
I have been waiting here with some such expectation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>holding the door</i>). If you go, I go too&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Don't be absurd. You will only be <i>de trop,</i> I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> <i>De trop</i> or not, I mean going&mdash;she shall choose between us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>turning pale</i>). I suppose you intend to enlighten her as
to my&mdash;er&mdash;little flirtation (before I knew <i>her</i>) with Miss Trotter? Do
it, Podbury, do it&mdash;if you think you'll gain any good by it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Telling tales is not exactly in my line. But you don't go
on that balcony without me&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, listen to reason, my dear fellow. What you propose
is ridiculous. I&mdash;I don't mind conceding this: we'll each go, and&mdash;er&mdash;tit
up, as you call it, which goes first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Done with you! (<i>Produces a mark.</i>) Sudden death. You're
Eagle&mdash;I'm the other Johnny. (<i>Tosses.</i>) Eagle! Confound you! But
I mean to have my innings all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You're perfectly welcome&mdash;when I've had mine. I'll&mdash;er&mdash;wish
you good evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>Courtship according to Mr. Ruskin.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Balcony outside the Musik-Saal of the Insel Hotel, Constance.</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> <i>is seated;</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is leaning against the
railing close by. It is about nine; the moon has risen, big and yellow,
behind the mountains at the further end of the Lake; small black boats
are shooting in and out of her track upon the water; the beat of the
steamers' paddles is heard as they come into harbour.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>has
just proposed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> (<i>after a silence</i>). I have already felt very strongly
with Ruskin, that no girl should have the cruelty to refuse a proposal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with alacrity</i>). Ruskin is always so right. And&mdash;er&mdash;where
there is such complete sympathy in tastes and ideas, as I venture to think
exists in our own case, the cruelty would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Pray allow me to finish! "Refuse a proposal <i>at once</i>" is
Ruskin's expression. He also says (if my memory does not betray me),
that "no lover should have the insolence to think of being accepted at
once." You will find the passage somewhere in <i>Fors</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>whose jaw has visibly fallen</i>). I cannot say I recall it at this
moment. Does he hold that a lover should expect to be accepted by&mdash;er&mdash;instalments,
because, if so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I think I can quote his exact words. "If she simply doesn't
like him, she may send him away for seven years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). No doubt that course is open to her. But why seven,
and where is he expected to go?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>continuing calmly</i>). "He vowing to live on cresses and wear
sackcloth meanwhile, or the like penance."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I feel bound to state at once that, in my own case, my
position at Somerset House would render anything of that sort utterly
impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Wait, please,&mdash;you are so impetuous. "If she likes him a
little,"&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Culchard's</span> <i>brow relaxes</i>)&mdash;"or thinks she might come to like
him in time, she may let him stay near her,"&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>makes a movement
of relief and gratitude</i>)&mdash;"putting him always on sharp trial, and
requiring, figuratively, as many lion-skins or giants' heads as she thinks
herself worth."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>grimly</i>). "Figuratively" is a distinct concession on Ruskin's
part. Still, I should be glad to know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> If you will have a little more patience, I will make myself
clear. I have always determined that when the&mdash;ah&mdash;occasion presented
itself, I would deal with it on Ruskinian principles. I propose in your
case&mdash;presuming of course that you are willing to be under vow for me&mdash;to
adopt a middle course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You are extremely good. And what precise form of&mdash;er&mdash;penance
did you think of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> The trial I impose is, that you leave Constance to-morrow&mdash;with
Mr. Podbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>firmly</i>). If you expect me to travel for seven years with him,
permit me to mention that I simply cannot do it. My leave expires in
three weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I mentioned no term, I believe. Long before three weeks
are over we shall meet again, and I shall be able to see how you have
borne the test. I wish you to correct, if possible, a certain intolerance
in your attitude towards Mr. Podbury. Do you accept this probation,
or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;ah&mdash;suppose I have no choice. But you really must allow
me to say that it is <i>not</i> precisely the reception I anticipated. Still, in your
service, I am willing to endure even Podbury&mdash;for a strictly limited period;
that I <i>do</i> stipulate for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> That, as I have already said, is quite understood. Now go
and arrange with Mr. Podbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself, as he retires</i>). It is <i>most</i> unsatisfactory; but at
least Podbury is disposed of!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The same Scene, a quarter of an hour later.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Prendergast.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a very long face</i>). No, I <i>say</i>, though! Ruskin doesn't say
all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I am not in the habit of misquoting. If you wish to verify
the quotation, however, I dare say I could find you the reference in <i>Fors
Clavigera</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>ruefully</i>). Thanks&mdash;I won't trouble you. Only it does seem
rather rough on fellows, don't you know. If every one went on his plan&mdash;well,
there wouldn't be many marriages! Still, I never thought you'd say
"Yes" right off. It's like my cheek, I know, to ask you at all; you're so
awfully clever and that. And if there's a chance for me, I'm game for
anything in the way of a trial. Don't make it stiffer than you can help,
that's all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> All I ask of you is to leave me for a short time, and go and
travel with Mr. Culchard again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, I say, Miss Prendergast, you know. Make it something
else. <i>Do!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> That is the task I require, and I can accept no other. It is
nothing, after all, but what you came out here to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I didn't know him <i>then</i>, you see. And what made me agree to
come away with him at all is beyond me. It was all Hughie Rose's doing&mdash;he
said we should get on together like blazes. So we have&mdash;<i>very</i> like
blazes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Never mind that. Are you willing to accept the trial or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> If you only knew what he's like when he's nasty, you'd let me
off&mdash;you would, really. But there, to please you, I'll do it. I'll stand him
as long as ever I can&mdash;'pon my honour I will. Only you'll make it up to
me afterwards, won't you now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I will make no promises&mdash;a true knight should expect no
reward for his service, Mr. Podbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>blankly</i>). Shouldn't he? I'm a little new to the business,
you see, and it <i>does</i> strike me&mdash;&mdash;but never mind. When am I to trot
him off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> As soon as you can induce him to go&mdash;to-morrow, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to himself, as he withdraws</i>). Well, I've let myself in for a nice
thing! Rummest way of treating a proposal <i>I</i> ever heard of. I should
just like to tell that fellow Ruskin what I think of his precious ideas. But
there's <i>one</i> thing, though&mdash;she can't care about Culchard, or she wouldn't
want him carted off like this.... Hooray, I never thought of that before!
Why, there he is, dodging about to find out how <i>I've</i> got on. I'll tackle
him straight off.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>meet at the head of the staircase, and

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Hullo! we're both of one mind for once, eh? (<i>To himself.</i>)
Poor old beggar! Got the sack! That explains a lot. Well, I won't tell
him anything about this business just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> So it appears. (<i>To himself.</i>) Had his <i>quietus</i>, evidently.
Ah, well, I won't exult over him.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>They go off together to consult a time-table.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>on the balcony musing</i>). Poor fellows! I couldn't very well
say anything more definite at present. By the time I see them again, I
may understand my own heart better. Really, it is rather an exciting
sensation, having two suitors under vow and doing penance at the same
time&mdash;and all for my sake! I hope, though, they won't mention it to one
another&mdash;or to Bob. Bob does not understand these things, and he might&mdash;&mdash;But
after all, there are only <i>two</i> of them. And Ruskin distinctly says
that every girl who is worth <i>anything</i> ought always to have half a dozen or
so. Two is really <i>quite</i> moderate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h3>Culchard descends from the Clouds.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>in Front of the Hôtel Bodenhaus at Splügen. The Diligence For
Bellinzona is having its team attached. An elderly Englishwoman is
sitting on her trunk, trying to run through the last hundred pages of a
novel from the Hotel Library before her departure.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>is in the
Hotel, negotiating for sandwiches.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is practising his Italian
upon a very dingy gentleman in smoked spectacles, with a shawl round
his throat.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dingy Italian</span> (<i>suddenly discovering</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard's</span> <i>nationality</i>).
Ecco, siete Inglese! Lat us spika Ingelis. I onnerstan' 'im to ze bottomside.
(<i>Laboriously, to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who tries to conceal his chagrin.</i>) 'Ow
menni time you employ to go since Coire at here? (C. <i>nods with vague
encouragement.</i>) Vich manners of vezzer you vere possess troo your
travels&mdash;mosh ommerella? (C.'s <i>eyes grow vacant.</i>) Ha, I <i>tink</i> it vood!
Zis day ze vicket root sall 'ave plenti 'orse to pull, &amp;c., &amp;c. (<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>overhearing this, with horror</i>). One minute, Culchard. (<i>He
draws him aside.</i>) I say, for goodness' sake, don't let's have that old
organ-grinding Johnny in the <i>coupé</i> with <i>us!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Organ-grinder! you are so <i>very</i> insular! For anything you
can tell, he may be a decayed nobleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>coarsely</i>). Well, let him decay somewhere else, that's all! Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
tell the Conductor to shove him in the <i>intérieur</i>, do, while I nip into the
<i>coupé</i> and keep our places.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>on reflection, adopts this suggestion, and the</i> <span class="smcap">Italian

<p class="center">IN THE BERNARDINO PASS, DURING THE ASCENT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Glorious view one gets at each fresh turn of the road,
Podbury! Look at Hinter-rhein, far down below there, like a toy village,
and that vast desolate valley, with the grey river rushing through it, and
the green glacier at the end, and these awful snow-covered peaks all
round&mdash;<i>look</i>, man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I'm looking, old chap. It's all there, right enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>vexed</i>). It doesn't seem to be making any particular impression
on you, I must say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> It's making me deuced peckish, I know that&mdash;how about
lunch, eh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>pained</i>). We are going through scenery like this, and all you
think of is&mdash;lunch! (<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>opens a basket.)</i> You may give me one of
those sandwiches. What made you get <i>veal</i>? and the bread's all crust,
too! Thanks, I'll take some claret.... (<i>They lunch; the vehicle meanwhile
toils up to the head of the Pass.</i>) Dear me, we're at the top already!
These rocks shut out the valley altogether&mdash;much colder at this height,
eh? Don't you find this keen air most exhilarating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>shivering</i>). Oh very, do you mind putting your window up?
Thanks. You seem uncommon chirpy to-day. Beginning to get <i>over</i>
it, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> We shan't get over it for some hours yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I didn't mean the Pass, I meant&mdash;(<i>hesitating</i>)&mdash;well, your little
affair with Miss Prendergast, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> My little affair? Get over? (<i>He suddenly understands.</i>)
Oh, ah, to be sure. Yes, thank you, my dear fellow, it is not making me
<i>particularly</i> unhappy.       [<i>He goes into a fit of silent laughter.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Glad to hear it. (<i>To himself.</i>) 'Jove, if he only knew what <i>I</i>
know!                      [<i>He chuckles.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> <i>You</i> don't appear to be exactly heartbroken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I? why <i>should</i> I be&mdash;about <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with an affectation of reserve</i>). Exactly, I was forgetting.
(<i>To himself.</i>) It's really rather humorous. (<i>He laughs again.</i>) Ha, we're
beginning to go down now. Hey for Italy&mdash;la bella Italia! (<i>The diligence
takes the first curve.</i>) Good Heavens, what a turn! We're going at rather
a sharp pace for downhill, eh? I suppose these Swiss drivers know what
they're about, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, yes, generally&mdash;when they're not drunk. I can only see
this fellow's boots&mdash;but they look to me a trifle squiffy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>inspecting them, anxiously)</i>. He does seem to drive very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
recklessly. <i>Look</i> at those leaders&mdash;heading right for the precipice....
Ah, just saved it! How we do lurch in swinging round!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Topheavy&mdash;I expect, too much luggage on board&mdash;have
another sandwich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Not for me, thanks. I say, I wonder if it's safe, having no
parapet, only these stone posts, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Safe enough&mdash;unless the wheel catches one&mdash;it was as near as
a toucher just then&mdash;aren't you going to smoke? No? <i>I</i> am. By the
way, what were you so amused about just now, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> <i>Was</i> I amused? (<i>The vehicle gives another tremendous lurch.</i>)
Really, this is <i>too</i> horrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with secret enjoyment.</i>) We're right enough, if the horses
don't happen to stumble. That off-leader isn't over sure-footed&mdash;did
you see <i>that</i>? (<span class="smcap">Culch.</span> <i>shudders.</i>) But what's the joke about Miss
Prendergast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>irritably</i>). Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't bother about that
<i>now</i>! I've something else to think about. My goodness, we were nearly
over that time! What are you looking at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>who has been leaning forward</i>). Only one of the traces&mdash;they've
done it up with a penny ball of string, but I dare say it will stand the
strain. You aren't <i>half</i> enjoying the view, old fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Yes, I am. Magnificent!&mdash;glorious!&mdash;isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Find you see it better with your eyes shut? But I say, I wish
you'd explain what you were sniggering at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Take my advice, and don't press me, my dear fellow; you
may regret it if you do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I'll risk it. It must be a devilish funny joke to tickle you like
that. Come, out with it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, if you must know, I was laughing.... Oh, he'll <i>never</i>
get those horses round in.... I was&mdash;er&mdash;rather amused by your evident
assumption that I must have been <i>rejected</i> by Miss Prendergast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, was <i>that</i> it? And you're nothing of the kind, eh?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He chuckles again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). No doubt you will find it very singular; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
as a matter of fact, she&mdash;well, she most certainly did not <i>discourage</i> my
pretensions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> The deuce she didn't! Did she tell you Ruskin's ideas about
courtship being a probation, and ask you if you were ready to be under
vow for her, by any chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> This is too bad, Podbury! you must have been there, or you
couldn't possibly know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Much obliged, I'm sure. I don't listen behind doors, as a
general thing. I suppose, now, she set you a trial of some kind, to prove
your mettle, eh?           [<i>With another chuckle.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>furiously</i>). Take care&mdash;or I may tell you more than you
bargain for!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Go on&mdash;never mind <i>me</i>. Bless you, <i>I'm</i> under vow for her too,
my dear boy. Fact!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> That's impossible, and I can prove it. The service she
demanded was, that I should leave Constance at once&mdash;with you. Do you
understand&mdash;with <i>you</i>, Podbury!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a prolonged whistle</i>). My aunt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>severely</i>). You may invoke every female relative you possess in
the world, but it won't alter the fact, and that alone ought to convince you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Hold on a bit. Wait till you've heard <i>my</i> penance. She told
me to cart <i>you</i> off. <i>Now</i>, then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>faintly</i>). If I thought she'd been trifling with us both like
that, I'd never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> She's no end of a clever girl, you know. And, after all, she
may only have wanted time to make up her mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>violently</i>). I tell you <i>what</i> she is&mdash;she's a cold-blooded
pedantic prig, and a systematic flirt! I loathe and detest a prig, but a
flirt I despise&mdash;yes, <i>despise</i>, Podbury!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with only apparent irrelevance</i>). The same to you, and many of
'em, old chap! Hullo, we're going to stop at this inn. Let's get out and
stretch our legs and have some coffee.</p>

this line was supposed to go to the top! But that's Italian all over&mdash;hem&mdash;as
Podbury would say! Wonder, by the way, if he expected to be
asked to come with me. I've no reason for sacrificing myself like that any
longer! (<i>He sighs.</i>) Ah, Hypatia, if you could know what a dreary disenchanted
blank you have made of my life! And I who believed you
capable of appreciating such devotion as mine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice Behind.</span> My! If I don't know that back I'll just give up!
How've <i>you</i> been getting along all this time, Mr. Culchard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>turning</i>). Miss Trotter! A most delightful and&mdash;er&mdash;unexpected
meeting, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Trotter.</span> Well, we came up on the cars in front of yours. We've
taken rooms at the hotel up here. Poppa reckoned the air would be kind
of fresher on the top of this mountain, and I don't believe but what he's
right either. I guess I shall want another hairpin through <i>my</i> hat. And
are you still going around with Mr. Podbury? As inseparable as ever,
I presume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Er&mdash;<i>about</i> as inseparable. That is, we are still travelling
together&mdash;only, on this particular afternoon&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> He went and got mislaid? I see. He used to stray considerable
over in Germany, didn't he? Well, I'm real pleased to see <i>you</i>
anyway. And how's the poetry been panning out? I hope you've had a
pretty good yield of sonnets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). She's really grown distinctly prettier. She
might show a little more <i>feeling</i>, though, considering we were almost, if not
quite&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) So you remember my poor poems? I'm afraid I have
not been very&mdash;er&mdash;prolific of late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You don't say! I should think you'd have had one to show
for every day, with the date to it, like a new-laid egg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Birds don't lay&mdash;er&mdash;I mean they don't <i>sing</i>, in the dark.
My light has been&mdash;er&mdash;lacking of late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> If that's intended for me, you ought to begin chirping right
away. But you're not going to tell me you've been "lounjun round en
sufferin'" like&mdash;wasn't it <i>Uncle Remus's</i> Brer Terrapin? (<i>Catching</i> <span class="smcap">C.'s</span>
<i>look of bewilderment.</i>) What, don't you know <i>Uncle Remus?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>politely</i>). Mr. Trotter is the only relation of yours I have had
the pleasure of meeting, as yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Why, I reckoned <i>Uncle Remus</i> was pretty most everybody's
relation by now. He's a book. But likely you've no use for our national
humorous literature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;must confess I seldom waste time over the humorous
literature of <i>any</i> nation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess that accounts for your gaiety! There, don't you
mind <i>me</i>, Mr. Culchard. But suppose we hurry along and inspect this
panorama they talk so much of; it isn't going to be any side-show. It's
just a real representative mass-meeting of Swiss mountains, with every
prominent peak in the country on the platform, and a deputation down
below from the leading Italian lakes. It's ever so elegant,&mdash;and there's
Poppa around on the top too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

up well, cert'nly, those peaks do. But I was about to remark, Sir, I went
to that particular establishment on Fleet Street. I called for a chop. And
when it came, I don't deny I felt disappointed, for the plate all around was
just as <i>dry</i>&mdash;! But the moment I struck a fork into that chop, Sir,&mdash;well,

all this way above the sea-level though, but I'm just as pleased to see him.
Rode up on the cars, I presume, Sir? Tolerable hilly road all the way,
<i>ain't</i> it now? There cann't anybody say we hain't made the most of <i>our</i>
time since you left us. Took a run over to Berlin; had two hours and a
haff in that city, and I dunno as I keered about making a more pro-tracted
visit. Went right through to Vi-enna, saw round Vi-enna. I did want,
being so near, to just waltz into Turkey and see that. But I guess
Turkey 'll have to keep till next time. Then back again into Switzerland,
for I do seem to have kinder taken a fancy to Switzerland. I'd like to
have put in more time there, and we stayed best part of a week too! But
Italy's an interesting place. Yes, I'm getting considerable interested in
Italy, so far as I've got. There's Geneva now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. V. B.</span> (<i>a slim, pale young man, with a cosmopolitan air and a languid
drawl</i>). It's our most pressing national need, Sir, and I have long
cherished the intention of supplying it. I am collecting material, and, when
the psychological moment arrives, I shall write that novel. And I believe
it will be a big thing, a very big thing; I mean to make it a complete
compendium of every phase of our great and complicated civilization from
State to State and from shore to shore.    [<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>bows vaguely</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Yes, and the great Amurrcan public are going to rise up in
their millions and boom it. Only I don't believe they'd better start booming
just yet, till there's something more than covers to that novel. And
how you're going to collect material for an Amurrcan novel, flying round
Europe, just beats <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. V. B.</span> (<i>with superiority</i>). Because you don't realize that it's precisely
in Europe that I find my best American types. Our citizens show up
better against a European background,&mdash;it excites and stimulates their
nationality, so to speak. And again, with a big subject like mine, you
want to step back to get the proper focus. Now I'm <i>stepping</i> back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess it's more like skipping, Charley. But so long as
you're having a good time! And here's Mr. Culchard will fix you up
some sonnets for headings to the chapters. You needn't begin <i>right</i> away,
Mr. Culchard; I guess there's no hurry. But we get talking and <i>talking</i>,
and never look at anything. I don't call it encouraging the scenery, and
that's a fact!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>later, to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>). And you're pretty comfortable at your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hotel? Well, I dunno, after all, what there is to keep <i>us</i> here. I guess
we'll go down again and stop at Lugano, eh, Maud?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>eagerly awaits her reply</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I declare! After bringing all my trunks way up here!
But I'd just as soon move down as not; they're not unpacked any. (<i>Joy
of</i> C.) Seems a pity, too, after engaging rooms here. And they looked
real nice. Mr. Culchard, don't you and Mr. Podbury want to come up
here and take them? They've a perfectly splendid view, and then we
could have yours, you know! (C. <i>cannot conceal his chagrin at this suggestion</i>.) Well, see here, Poppa, we'll go along and try if we can't square the
hotel-clerk and get our baggage on the cars again, and then we'll see just
how we feel about it. I'm purrfectly indifferent either way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself, as he follows</i>). Can she be really as indifferent as
she seems? I'm afraid she has very little heart! But if only she can be
induced to go back to Lugano.... She will be at the same hotel&mdash;a great
point! I wish that fellow Van Boodeler wasn't coming too, though....
Not that they've settled to come at all yet!... Still, I fancy she likes the
idea.... She'll come&mdash;if I don't appear too anxious about it!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>Miss Banquo.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Gardens belonging to the Hôtel du Parc, Lugano. Time, afternoon;
the orchestra is turning up in a kiosk.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is seated on
a bench in the shade, keeping an anxious eye upon the opposite door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). She said she had a headache, and made her father and Van Boodeler go out on the lake without her. But she
certainly gave me to understand that she might come out when the
band played, if she felt better. The question is, whether she <i>means</i>
to feel better or not. She is the most tantalizing girl! <i>I</i> don't know
what to make of her. Not a single reference, as yet, to that last talk
we had at Bingen. I must see if I can't recall it to her memory&mdash;if she
comes. I'll wait here, on the chance of it&mdash;we are not likely to be dis&mdash;&mdash;.
Confound it all&mdash;Podbury! (<i>with suppressed irritation as</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>comes
up</i>). Well, do you <i>want</i> anything in particular?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>cheerfully, as he sits down</i>). Only the pleasure of your society,
old chap. How nicely you do put things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> The&mdash;er&mdash;fact is, I can't promise to be a particularly lively
companion just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Not by way of a change? Ah, well, it's a pity&mdash;but I must
put up with you as you are, I suppose. You see&mdash;(<i>with a grin</i>)&mdash;I've
got that vow to work out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Possibly&mdash;but <i>I</i> haven't. As I've already told you&mdash;I retire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Wobbled back to Miss Trotter again, eh? Matter of taste,
of course, but, for my part, I think your <i>first</i> impression of her was
nearer the truth&mdash;she's not what I call a highly cultivated sort of girl,
y' know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You are naturally exacting on that point, but have the
goodness to leave my first impressions alone, and&mdash;er&mdash;frankly, Podbury,
I see no necessity (<i>now</i>, at all events) to take that ridiculous&mdash;hum&mdash;penance
<i>too</i> literally. We are <i>travelling</i> together, and I imagine that is
enough for Miss Prendergast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> It's enough for <i>me</i>&mdash;especially when you make yourself so
doosid amiable as this. You needn't alarm yourself&mdash;you won't have
any more of my company than I can help; only I <i>must</i> say, for two
fellows who came out to do a tour <i>together</i>, it's&mdash;&mdash;      [<i>Walks away, grumbling.</i></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Later. The band has finished playing</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> <i>is on
the bench with</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> And you mean to tell me you've never met anybody since
you even cared to converse with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>diplomatically</i>). Does that strike you as so very incredible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, it strikes me as just a <i>little</i> too thin. I judged you'd
go away, and forget I ever existed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with tender reproach</i>). How little you know me! I may
not be an&mdash;er&mdash;demonstrative man, my&mdash;er&mdash;feelings are not easily
roused, but, once roused, well&mdash;(<i>wounded</i>)&mdash;I think I may claim to
possess an ordinary degree of constancy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I'm sure I <i>ought</i> to feel it a vurry high compliment
to have you going round grieving all this time on <i>my</i> account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Grieving! Ah, if I could only <i>tell</i> you what I went through!
(<i>Decides, on reflection, that the less he says about this the better.</i>) But all
that is past. And now may I not expect a more definite answer to
the question I asked at Bingen? Your reply then was&mdash;well, a little
ambiguous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess it's got to be just about as ambiguous now&mdash;there
don't seem anything I <i>can</i> say. There's times when I feel as if it might
be sort of elevating and improving to have you shining around; and
there's other times when I suspect that, if it went on for any considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
period, likely I'd weaken. I'm not just sure. And I cann't ever make
myself believe but what you're disapproving of me, inside of you, most
all the time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Pray dismiss such&mdash;er&mdash;morbid misgivings, dear Miss Trotter.
Show that you do so by accepting me as your guide and companion
through life!</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ME.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> My! but that sounds like a proposal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I intended it to bear that&mdash;er&mdash;construction. It <i>is</i> a proposal&mdash;made
after the fullest reflection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I'm ever so obliged. But we don't fix things quite that way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in my country. We want to feel pretty sure, first, we shann't get left.
And it don't seem to me as if I'd had opportunities enough of studying
your leading characteristics. I'll have to study them some more before
I know whereabouts I am; and I want you to understand that I'm not
going to commit myself to anything at present. That mayn't be sentiment,
but I guess it's common-sense, anyway. And all <i>you</i>'ve got to
do is, just to keep around, and kind of impress me with a conviction
that you're the vurry brightest and best man in the entire universe,
and I don't believe you'll find much difficulty about <i>that</i>. And now I
guess we'll go into <i>table d'hôte</i>&mdash;I'm just as <i>ravenous</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself, as he follows her</i>). Really, this is not much better
than Ruskin, after all. But I don't despair. That last remark was
distinctly encouraging!</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A large Salle à Manger, decorated in the Pompeian style. Table
d'hôte has begun.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is seated between</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> <i>and
a large and conversational stranger. Opposite are three empty chairs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard's Neighbour.</span> Then you're going on to Venice? Well,
you take <i>my</i> advice. When you get there, you ask for tunny. Don't
forget&mdash;<i>tunny</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who wants to talk to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span>). Tunny? Thank you. I&mdash;er&mdash;will
certainly remember his name, if I require a guide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His N.</span> A guide? No, no&mdash;tunny's a <i>fish</i>, Sir, a coarse red fish,
with flesh like a raw beefsteak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Is that so? Then I will make a point of asking for it&mdash;if
I want raw beefsteak.      [<i>Attempts to turn to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">His N.</span> That's what <i>I</i> did when I was at Venice. I sent for the
Manager. He came. I said to him, "Look here, I'm an Englishman.
My name's Bellerby. (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>bows in patient boredom</i>.) I've heard
of your Venetian tunny. I wish to taste it. <i>Bring</i> me some!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>crushingly</i>). A most excellent method of obtaining it, no
doubt. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Waiter</span>.) <i>Numéro vingt-sept, demi bouteille de Chianti,
et siphon!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">His N.</span> You don't wait till I've <i>done</i>, Sir! I <i>didn't</i> obtain it&mdash;not
at first. The man made excuses. I was prepared for <i>that</i>. I told
him plainly, "I know what <i>you</i>'re thinking&mdash;it's a cheap fish, and you
fancy I'm ordering it out of economy!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>raising his eyebrows for</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.'s</span> <i>benefit</i>). Of course, he
naturally <i>would</i> think so. And <i>that</i> is how you got your tunny?
I see.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Bellerby</span> <i>stares at him suspiciously, and decides to suppress
the remainder of his tunny.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> This hotel seems to be thinning some. We've three ghosts
right in front of us this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>turning with effusion</i>). So we have! My friend is one,
and he'll be here presently, but I much prefer myself to see every seat
occupied. There is something so depressing about a vacant chair, don't
you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> It's calculated to put one in mind of <i>Macbeth's</i> little
dinner-party, certainly. But you can cheer up, Mr. Culchard, here
comes a couple of belated <i>Banquos</i>. My gracious, I <i>do</i> like that girl's
face&mdash;she has such a perfectly lovely expression, and looks real superior
too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who has just dropped his glasses into his soup</i>). I&mdash;ah&mdash;which
lady are you referring to? (<i>He cleans and adjusts his glasses&mdash;to
discover that he is face to face with</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Hypatia Prendergast</span>.)
Oh ... I&mdash;I see&mdash;precisely, quite so! (<i>He turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Bellerby</span> <i>to cover
his confusion and avoid meeting</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast's</span> <i>eye</i>.) I <i>beg</i> your
pardon, you were describing how you caught a tunny? Pray continue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bellerby</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). Excuse me, I don't seem fortunate enough
to have secured your undivided attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with intense interest</i>). Quite the contrary, I assure you!
You were saying you always ordered it out of economy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Pardon <i>me</i>&mdash;I was saying nothing of the sort. I was saying
that I told the Manager I knew that was why he <i>thought</i> I ordered it&mdash;a
rather different thing! "You're quite wrong," I said. "You may
pay twopence-halfpenny a pound for it, and charge me half-a-crown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
if you like, but I mean to <i>taste</i> that tunny!" I was determined not to
be done out of my tunny, Sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>breathlessly</i>). And what did the tunny&mdash;I mean the Manager&mdash;say
to <i>that</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Oh, made more difficulties&mdash;it wasn't to be got, and so on.
At last I said to him (very quietly, but he saw I was in earnest), "Now
I tell you what it <i>is</i>&mdash;I'm going to <i>have</i> that tunny, and, if you refuse to
give it me,&mdash;well, I shall just send my courier <i>out</i> for it, that's all!" So,
with <i>that</i>, they brought me some&mdash;and anything more delicious I never
tasted in all my life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). If I can only keep him on at this tunny!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) And&mdash;er&mdash;what <i>does</i> it taste like exactly, now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>pregnantly.</i>) You <i>order</i> it, Sir&mdash;<i>insist</i> on having it. Then
you'll <i>know</i> what it tastes like!      [<i>He devotes himself to his soup.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with his eyes lowered&mdash;to himself.</i>) I <i>must</i> look up in another
<i>minute</i>&mdash;and then!                 [<i>He shivers.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>Culchard comes out Nobly.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Table d'Hôte at Lugano</i>; <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>has not yet caught</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast's</span> <i>eye</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bellerby</span>). Have you&mdash;ah&mdash;been up Monte
Generoso yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> No. (<i>After reflecting.</i>) No, I haven't. But I was greatly
struck by its remarkably bold outline from below. Indeed, I dashed
off a rough sketch of it on the back of one of my visiting cards.
I ought to have it somewhere about me now. (<i>Searching himself.</i>) Ah,
I thought so! (<i>Handing a vague little scrawl to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who examines
it with the deepest interest</i>.) I knock off quite a number of these while
I'm abroad like this. Send 'em in letters to relatives at home&mdash;gives
them a notion of the place. They are&mdash;ar&mdash;kind enough to value
them. (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>makes a complimentary mumble</i>.) Yes, I'm a very
rapid sketcher. Put me with regular artists, and give us half an hour,
and I&mdash;ar&mdash;venture to say I should be on terms with them. Make it
<i>three</i> hours, and&mdash;well, I dare say I shouldn't be in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury</span> (<i>who has dropped into the chair next to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span>
<i>and her brother</i>). Bob, old chap, I'll come in the middle, if you don't
mind. I say, this <i>is</i> ripping&mdash;no idea of coming across you so soon
as this. (<i>Lowering his voice, to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>) Still pegging away at my
"penance," you see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prend.</span> The pleasure is more than mutual; but do I understand
that Mr.&mdash;&mdash;? So <i>tiresome</i>, I left my glasses up in my room!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She peers up and down the line of faces on her own side of the table.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culch.</span>). I want you should notice that girl. I think
she looks just as nice as she can be, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>carefully looking in every other direction</i>). I&mdash;er&mdash;mumble&mdash;mumble&mdash;don't
exactly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>). No&mdash;not this side&mdash;just opposite. (<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Culch.</span>,
<i>in fingering a siphon which is remarkably stiff on the trigger, contrives
to send a spray across the table and sprinkle</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span>, <i>her
brother, and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>, <i>with impartial liberality</i>). <i>Now</i> don't you see
him? As playful as ever, isn't he! Don't try to make out it was

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>graciously</i>). Pray don't apologize, Mr. Culchard; not the
least harm done! You must forgive me for not recognizing you before,
but you know of old how provokingly short-sighted I am, and I've
forgotten my glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>indistinctly</i>). I&mdash;er&mdash;not at all ... most distressed, I assure
you ... really no notion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>in an undertone</i>). Say, you <i>know</i> her, then? And you
never let on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Didn't I? Oh, surely! yes, I've&mdash;er&mdash;<i>met</i> that lady. (<i>With
grateful deference to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bellerby</span>, <i>who has just addressed him.</i>) You
are an Art-Collector? Indeed? And&mdash;er&mdash;have you&mdash;er&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I've the three finest Bodgers in the kingdom, Sir, and
there's a Gubbins&mdash;a <i>Joe</i> Gubbins, mind you, not <i>John</i>&mdash;that's hanging
now in the morning-room of my place in the country that I wouldn't
take a thousand pounds for! I go about using my eyes, and pick 'em
up cheap. Cheapest picture <i>I</i> ever bought was a Prout&mdash;thirty-two by
twenty; got it for two pound ten! Unfinished, of course, but it only
wanted the colour being brought up to the edge. <i>I</i> did that. Took
me half a day, and <i>now</i>&mdash;well, any dealer would give me hundreds
for it! But I shall leave it to the nation, out of respect for Prout's
memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob Pr.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>). Yes, came over by the St. Gothard. Who
is that girl who was talking to Culchard just now? Do you know
her? I say, I wish you'd introduce me some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>). You don't seem vurry bright this evening.
I'd like you to converse with your friend opposite, so I could get a
chance to chip in. I'm ever so interested in that girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Presently&mdash;presently, if I have an opportunity. (<i>Hastily
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span>) I gather that you paint yourself, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Well, yes. I assure you I often go to a Gallery, see a
picture there that takes my fancy, go back to my office, and paint it
in half an hour from memory&mdash;so like the original that, if it were
framed, and hung up alongside, it would puzzle the man who painted
it to know t'other from which! I have indeed! I paint original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pictures, too. Most important thing I ever did was&mdash;let me see now&mdash;three
feet by two and three-quarters. I was most successful in getting
an effect of rose-coloured snow against the sky. I sponged it up, and&mdash;well,
it came right somehow. <i>Luck</i>, that was, not skill, you know.
I sent that picture to the Royal Academy, and they did me the honour
to&mdash;ar&mdash;reject it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>vaguely</i>). An&mdash;er&mdash;honour, indeed.&mdash;(<i>In despair, as</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span>
<i>rises.</i>)&mdash;You&mdash;&mdash;You're not <i>going!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>consolingly</i>). Only into the garden, for coffee. I observe
you are interested in Art. We will&mdash;ar&mdash;resume this conversation later.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Rises</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> <i>rises too, and goes towards the garden.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>as he follows, hastily</i>). I must get this business over&mdash;if I
can. But I wish I knew exactly <i>how</i> much to tell her. It's really
very awkward&mdash;between the two of them. I'm afraid I've been a little
too precipitate.</p>


<p class="center">IN THE GARDEN; A FEW MINUTES LATER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Prend.</span> (<i>who has retired to fetch her glasses&mdash;with gracious
playfulness</i>). Well, Mr. Culchard, and how has my knight performed
his lady's behests?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> May I ask <i>which</i> knight you refer to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>slightly changing countenance</i>). Which! Then&mdash;you know
there is another? Surely there is nothing in that circumstance to&mdash;to
offend&mdash;or hurt you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Offended? (<i>Considers whether this would be a good line to
take.</i>) Hardly <i>that</i>. Hurt? Well, I confess to being pained&mdash;very much
pained, to discover that I was unconsciously pitted&mdash;against Podbury!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> But why? I have expressed no preference as yet. You
can scarcely have become so attached to him that you dread the result
of a successful rivalry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). It's a loop-hole&mdash;I'll try it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) You
have divined my feeling exactly. In&mdash;er&mdash;obeying your commands, I
have learned to know Podbury better&mdash;to see in him a sterling nature,
more worthy, in some respects, than my own. And I know how deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he has centred all his hopes upon you, Miss Prendergast. Knowing,
seeing that as I&mdash;er&mdash;<i>do</i>, I feel that&mdash;whatever it costs me&mdash;I cannot
run the risk of wrecking the&mdash;er&mdash;life's happiness of so good a fellow.
So you must really allow me to renounce vows accepted under&mdash;er&mdash;an
imperfect comprehension of the&mdash;er&mdash;facts!           [<i>Wipes his brow.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> This is quite too Quixotic. Reflect, Mr. Culchard. Is
such a sacrifice demanded of you? I assure you I am perfectly neutral
at present. I <i>might</i> prefer Mr. Podbury. I <i>really</i> don't know. And&mdash;and
I don't <i>like</i> losing one of my suitors like this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Don't tempt me! I&mdash;I mustn't listen, I cannot. No, I
renounce. Be kind to Podbury&mdash;try to recognize the good in him ...
he is so devoted to you&mdash;make him happy, if you can!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>affected</i>). I&mdash;I really can't tell you how touched I am,
Mr. Culchard. I can guess what this renunciation must have cost you.
It&mdash;it gives me a better opinion of human nature ... it does, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>loftily, as she rises to go in</i>). Ah, Miss Prendergast, <i>don't</i>
lose your faith in human nature! Trust me, it is&mdash;er&mdash;full of surprises!
(<i>Alone.</i>) Now am I an abominable humbug, or what? I swear I felt
every word I said, at the time. Curious psychological state to be in.
But I'm out of what might have been a very unpleasant mess, at all
events!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>coming upon him from round a corner</i>). Well, I'm <i>sure</i>, Mr.
Culchard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You are a young lady of naturally strong convictions, I am
aware. But what are you so sure of at the present moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I guess I'm not just as sure of <i>you</i> as I should like
to be, anyway. Seems to me, considering you've been so vurry inconsolable
away from me, you'd a good deal to say to that young lady
in the patent folders. And I'd like an explanation&mdash;you're right down
splendid at explaining most things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with virtuous indignation</i>). So you actually suspect me of
having carried on a flirtation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess girls don't use their pocket-handkerchiefs that
way over the weather. Who <i>is</i> she, anyway?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>calmly</i>). If you insist on knowing, she is the lady to whom
Mr. Podbury has every prospect of being engaged. I hope your mind
is at ease <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I expect my mind would have stood the strain as
it was&mdash;so it's Mr. Podbury who's her admirer? See here, you're going
to introduce me to that girl right away. It's real romantic, and I'm
perfectly dying to make her acquaintance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Hum&mdash;well. She is&mdash;er&mdash;<i>peculiar</i>, don't you know, and I
rather doubt whether you will have much in common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, if you don't introduce me, I shall introduce myself,
that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> By all means. (<i>To himself.</i>) Not if <i>I</i> can prevent it,
though!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>Culchard feels slightly Uncomfortable.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Terrace and Grounds of the Grand Hôtel Villa d'Este, on Lake
Como.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>are walking up and down together.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well, old chap, your resigning like that has made all the
difference to <i>me</i>, I can tell you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I have succeeded in advancing your cause with Miss
Prendergast, I am all the better pleased, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> You have, and no mistake. She's regularly taken me in hand,
don't you know&mdash;she says I've no intelligent appreciation of Italian Art;
and gad, I believe she's right there! But I'm pulling up&mdash;bound to teach
you a lot, seeing all the old altar-pieces I do! And she gives me the right
tips, don't you see; she's no end of a clever girl, so well-read and all that!
But I say&mdash;about Miss Trotter? Don't want to be inquisitive, you know,
but you don't seem to be much <i>about</i> with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;the feelings I entertain towards Miss Trotter have
suffered no change&mdash;quite the reverse, only&mdash;and I wish to impress this
upon you, Podbury&mdash;it is undesirable, for&mdash;er&mdash;many reasons, to make my
attentions&mdash;er&mdash;too conspicuous. I&mdash;I trust you have not alluded to the
matter to&mdash;well, to Miss Prendergast, for example?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Not I, old fellow&mdash;got other things to talk about. But I don't
quite see why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You are not <i>required</i> to see. I don't <span class="smcap">wish</span> it, that is all.
I&mdash;er&mdash;think that should be sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, all right, <i>I'll</i> keep dark. But she's bound to know sooner
or later, now she and Miss Trotter have struck up such a friendship. And
Hypatia will be awfully pleased about it&mdash;why <i>shouldn't</i> she, you
know? ... I'm going to see if there's any one on the tennis-court, and
get a game if I can. Ta-ta!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>alone</i>). Podbury knows very little about women. If Hyp&mdash;Miss
Prendergast&mdash;once found out <i>why</i> I renounced my suitorship, I
should have very little peace, I know that&mdash;I've taken particular care not
to betray my attachment to Maud. I'm afraid she's beginning to notice it,
but I must be careful. I don't like this sudden intimacy between them&mdash;it
makes things so very awkward. They've been sitting under that tree over
there for the last half-hour, and goodness only knows what confidences they
may have exchanged! I really must go up and put a stop to it, presently.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">UNDER THE TREE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hypatia.</span> I only tell you all this, dearest, because I <i>do</i> think you
have rather too low an opinion of men as a class, and I wanted to show
you that I have met at least <i>one</i> man who was capable of a real and
disinterested devotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, I allowed that was about your idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> And don't you recognize that it was very fine of him to give
up everything for his friend's sake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> I guess it depends how much "everything" amounted to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). I thought, darling, I had made it perfectly plain what
a sacrifice it meant to him. <i>I</i> know how much he&mdash;I needn't tell you
there are certain symptoms one can<i>not</i> be deceived in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> No, I guess you needn't tell me <i>that</i>, love. And it was
perfectly lovely of him to give you up, when he was under vow for you and
all, sooner than stand in his friend's light&mdash;only I don't just see how that
was going to help his friend any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> Don't you really? Not when the friend was under vow for
me too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, Hypatia Prendergast! And how many admirers do
you have around under vow, as a regular thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> There were only those two. Ruskin permits as many as seven
at one time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> That's a vurry liberal allowance, too. I don't see how
there'd be sufficient suitors to go round. But maybe each gentleman
can be under vow for seven distinct girls, to make things sort of
square now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> Certainly not. The whole beauty of the idea lies in the
unselfish and exclusive devotion of every knight to the same sovereign
lady. In this case I happen to know that the&mdash;a&mdash;individual had never
met his ideal until&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Until he met you? At Nuremberg, wasn't it? My! And
what was his name? Do tell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> You must not press me, dear Maud, for I cannot tell that&mdash;even
to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> I don't believe but what I could guess. But say, you didn't
care any for <i>him</i>, or you'd never have let him go like that? <i>I</i> wouldn't.
I should have suspected there was something behind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> My feelings towards him were purely potential. I did him the
simple justice to believe that his self-abnegation was sincere. But, with
your practical, cynical little mind, darling, you are hardly capable of&mdash;excuse
me for saying so&mdash;of appreciating the real value and meaning of
such magnanimity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Oh, I guess I <i>am</i>, though. Why, here's Mr. Culchard coming
along. Well, Mr. Culchard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;ah&mdash;appear to have interrupted a highly interesting
conversation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, we were having a little discussion, and I guess you're
in time to give the casting vote&mdash;Hypatia, you want to keep just
where you are, do you hear? I mean you should listen to Mr. Culchard's
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>flattered</i>). Which I shall be delighted to give, if you will put
me in possession of the&mdash;er&mdash;facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, these are the&mdash;er&mdash;facts. There were two gentlemen
under vow&mdash;maybe you'll understand the working of that arrangement
better than I do?&mdash;under vow for the same young lady. [Hypatia
Prendergast, sit still, or I declare I'll pinch you!] One of them comes
up and tells her that he's arrived at the conclusion the other admirer
is the better man, and, being a friend of his, he ought to retire in his
favour, and he does it, too, right away. Now <i>I</i> say that isn't natural&mdash;he'd
some other motive. Miss Prendergast here will have it he was
one of those noble unselfish natures that deserve they should be
stuffed for a dime museum. What's <i>your</i> opinion now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>perspiring freely</i>). Why&mdash;er&mdash;really, on so delicate a matter,
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;                    [<i>He maunders.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> Maud, why <i>will</i> you be so headstrong! (<i>In a rapid whisper.</i>)
Can't you see ... can't you <i>guess</i>?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> I guess I want to make sure Mr. Culchard isn't that kind of
magnanimous man himself. I shouldn't want him to renounce <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> Maud! You might at <i>least</i> wait until Mr. Culchard has&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Oh, but he <i>did</i>&mdash;weeks ago, at Bingen. And at Lugano, too,
the other day, he spoke out tolerable plain. I guess he didn't wish any
secret made about it&mdash;<i>did</i> you, Mr. Culchard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;ah&mdash;this conversation is rather.... If you'll excuse
me&mdash;&mdash;      [<i>Escapes with as much dignity as he can command.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, my dear,&mdash;that's the sort of self-denying hairpin <i>he</i> is!
What do you think of him <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> I do not think so highly of him, I confess. His renunciation
was evidently less prompted by consideration for his friend than by a
recollection&mdash;tardy enough, I am afraid&mdash;of the duty which bound him to
<i>you</i>, dearest. But if you had seen and heard him, as I did, you would not
have doubted the <i>reality</i> of the sacrifice, whatever the true reason may
have been. For myself, I am conscious of neither anger nor sorrow&mdash;my
heart, as I told you, was never really affected. But what must it be to <i>you</i>,
darling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> Well, I believe I'm more amused than anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyp.</span> Amused! But surely you don't mean to have anything more
to do with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span> My dear girl, I intend to have considerable more to do with
him before I'm through. He's under vow for <i>me</i> now, anyway, and I don't
mean he should forget it, either. He's my monkey, and he's got to jump
around pretty lively, at the end of a tolerable short chain, too. And I
guess, if it comes to renouncing, all the magnanimity's going to be on <i>my</i>
side this time!</p>


<p class="center">IN AN AVENUE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself, as he walks hurriedly on</i>). I only just saved myself
in time. I don't <i>think</i> Maud noticed anything&mdash;she couldn't have been so
innocent and indifferent if she had.... And Hypatia won't enlighten her
any further now&mdash;after what she knows. It's rather a relief that she <i>does</i>
know.... She took it very well, poor girl&mdash;<i>very</i> well. I expect she is
really beginning to put up with Podbury&mdash;I'm sure I <i>hope</i> so, sincerely!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>Culchard cannot be "Happy with Either."</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Under the Colonnade of the Hôtel Grande Bretagne, Bellagio.</i>
<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is sitting by one of the pillars, engaged in constructing a
sonnet. On a neighbouring seat a group of smart people are talking over
their acquaintances, and near them is another visitor, a</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Crawley
Strutt</span>, <i>who is watching his opportunity to strike into the conversation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hurlingham.</span> Well, she'll <i>be</i> Lady Chesepare some day, when
anything happens to the old Earl. He was looking quite ghastly when we
were down at Skympings last. But they're frightfully badly off <i>now</i>, poor
dears! Lady Driblett lets them have her house in Park Lane for parties
and that&mdash;but it's wonderful how they live at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Sandown.</span> He looked pretty fit at the Rag the other day.
Come across the Senlacs anywhere? Thought Lady Senlac was going
abroad this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crawley Strutt.</span> Hem&mdash;I saw it mentioned in the <i>Penny
Patrician</i> that her Ladyship had&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hurl.</span> (<i>without taking the slightest notice of him</i>). She's just
been marryin' her daughter, you know&mdash;rather a good match, too. Not
what I call pretty,&mdash;smart-lookin', that's all. But then her <i>sister</i> wasn't
pretty till she married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Sand.</span> Nice family she married into! Met her father-in-law, old
Lord Bletherham, the other morning, at a chemist's in Piccadilly&mdash;he'd
dropped in there for a pick-me-up; and there he was, tellin' the chemist
all the troubles he'd had with his other sons marryin' the way they did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and that. Rum man to go and confide in his chemist, but he's like that&mdash;fond
of the vine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. S.</span> (<i>deferentially</i>). No doubt you're right, Sir, but I <i>like</i> the

Goslington's? Something very mysterious about the party he's going

<p><span class="smcap">Col. S.</span> Can't say, I'm sure&mdash;no business of mine, you know.</p>

objection to travel always is, that it brings you in contact with parties you

remark to a very pleasant little fellow I met on the steamer&mdash;er&mdash;Lord
Uppersole, I think it was&mdash;and he entirely concurred. Your friend made

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. S.</span> A highly agreeable spot to stay at. Indeed, I've some idea
myself of&mdash;&mdash;Exceedingly pleasant person his Lordship&mdash;so affable, so
completely the gentleman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, he's affable enough&mdash;for a boot-maker. I always give him
a title when I see him, for the joke of the thing&mdash;he likes it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. S.</span> <i>He</i> may, Sir. I consider a title is not a thing to be
treated in that light manner. It&mdash;it was an unpardonable liberty to
force me into the society of that class of person&mdash;unpardonable, Sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with alacrity</i>). I agree with Miss Prendergast. A short cut
is invariably the most indirect route.</p>

I particularly wish you to observe the effect of light on those cliffs&mdash;it's
well worth your while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Why, certainly, it's a view that does you infinite credit. Oh,
you <i>didn't</i> take any hand in the arrangement? But ain't you afraid if you
go around patting the scenery on the head this way, you'll have the lake
overflow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> Ha-ha-ha! One in the eye for <i>you</i>, Culchard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). Surely one may express a natural enthusiasm
without laying oneself open&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Gracious, yes! I should hope you wouldn't want to show
your enthusiasm <i>that</i> way&mdash;like a Japanese nobleman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Now that's coarse&mdash;<i>really</i> coarse!&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)&mdash;I
seem to be unable to open my mouth now without some ridiculous
distortion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> My!&mdash;but that's a serious symptom&mdash;isn't it? You don't feel
like you were going to have lock-jaw, do you, Mr. Culchard?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>falls back to the rear once more. Later</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Van
Boodeler</span> <i>has joined the party</i>; <span class="smcap">Hypatia</span> <i>has contrived to
detach her brother</i>. <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>has sought refuge with</i>
<span class="smcap">Podbury</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Van B.</span>). So that's what kept you? Well, it sounds just
too enchanting. But I cann't answer for what Miss Prendergast will say
to it. It mayn't suit her notions of propriety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Van B.</span> I expect she'll be superior to Britannic prejudices of that
kind. I consider your friend a highly cultivated and charming lady, Maud.
She produces that impression upon me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I presume, from that, she has shown an intelligent interest in
the great Amurrcan novel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Van B.</span> Why, yes; it enlists her literary sympathies&mdash;she sees
all its possibilities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> And they're pretty numerous, too. But here she comes.
You'd better tell her your plan right now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>in an earnest undertone to</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, <i>as they approach, followed by</i>
<span class="smcap">Culch.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pod.</span>). You <i>must</i> try and be sensible about it, Bob; if <i>you</i>
are too blind to see that she is only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). All <i>right!</i> Haven't I <i>said</i> I'd go? What's the good
of <i>jawing</i> about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. V. B.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>). I've been telling my cousin I've been organising
a little water-party for this evening&mdash;moonlight, mandolins, Menaggio.
If you find the alliteration has any attractions, I hope you and your
brother will do me the pleasure of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> I'm afraid not, thanks. We have all our packing to do. We

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>A Suspension of Hostilities.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The roof of Milan Cathedral; the innumerable statues and fretted
pinnacles show in dazzling relief against the intense blue sky. Through
the open-work of the parapet is seen the vast Piazza, with its yellow toy
tram cars, and the small crawling figures which cast inordinately long
shadows. All around is a maze of pale brown roofs, and beyond, the
green plain blending on the horizon with dove-coloured clouds in a
quivering violet haze.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is sitting by a small doorway at the
foot of a flight of steps leading to the Spire</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>meditating</i>). I think Maud must have seen from the tone
in which I said I preferred to remain below, that I object to that cousin of
hers perpetually coming about with us as he does. She's far too indulgent
to him&mdash;a posing, affected prig, always talking about the wonderful things
he's <i>going</i> to write! He had the impudence to tell me I didn't know the
most elementary laws of the sonnet this morning! Withering repartee
seems to have no effect whatever on him. I wish I had some of Podbury's
faculty for flippant chaff! I wonder if he and the Prendergasts really are
at Milan. I certainly thought I recognised&mdash;&mdash; If they are, it's very bad
taste of them, after the pointed way in which they left Bellagio. I only
hope we shan't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Here the figure of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> <i>suddenly emerges from the
door</i>; <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>rises and stands aside to let her pass; she
returns his salutation distantly, and passes on with her chin in
the air; her brother follows, with a side-jerk of recognition.</i>
<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>comes last, and halts undecidedly.</i></p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a rather awkward laugh</i>). Here we are again, eh? (<i>Looks
after</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>, <i>hesitates, and finally sits down by</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.) Where's the
fascinating Miss Trotter? How do you come to be off duty like this?</p>

<span class="caption">SHE PASSES ON WITH HER CHIN IN THE AIR.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). The fascinating Miss Trotter is up above with Van
Boodeler, so my services are not required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Up above? And Hypatia just gone up with Bob! Whew,
there'll be ructions presently! Well out of it, you and I! So it's Boodeler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
turn now? That's rough on <i>you</i>&mdash;after Hypatia had whistled poor old
Bob off. As much out in the cold as ever, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I am nothing of the kind. I find him distasteful to me, and
avoid him as much as I can, that's all. I wish, Podbury, er&mdash;I <i>almost</i> wish
you could have stayed with me, instead of allowing the Prendergasts to
carry you off as they did. You would have kept Van Boodeler in order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Much obliged, old chap; but I'm otherwise engaged. Being
kept in order myself. Oh, I <i>like</i> it, you know. She's developing my mind
like winking. Spent the whole morning at the Brera, mugging up these
old Italian Johnnies. They really are clinkers, you know. Raphael,
eh?&mdash;and Giotto, and Mantegna, and all that lot. As Hypatia says, for
intensity of&mdash;er&mdash;religious feeling, and&mdash;and subtlety of symbolism, and&mdash;and
so on, they simply take the cake&mdash;romp in, and the rest nowhere!
I'm getting quite the connoisseur, I can tell you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Evidently. I suppose there's no chance of a&mdash;a <i>reconciliation</i>
up there?            [<i>With some alarm.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Don't you be afraid. When Hypatia once gets her quills up,
they don't subside so easily! Hallo! isn't this old Trotter?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>That gentleman appears in the doorway.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Why, Mr. Podbury, so you've come along here? That's
<i>right</i>! And how do you like Milan? I like the place first-rate&mdash;it's a
live city, Sir. And I like this old cathedral, too; it's well constructed&mdash;they've
laid out money on it. I call it real ornamental, all these little
figgers they've stuck around&mdash;and not two of 'em a pair either. Now,
they might have had 'em all alike, and no one any the wiser up so high as
this; but it certainly gives it more variety, too, having them different.
Well, I'm going up as high as ever I <i>can</i> go. You two better come along
up with me.</p>


<p class="center">ON THE TOP.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>as she perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> <i>and her companion</i>). Now, Bob, pray
remember all I've told you!         [<span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>turns away, petulantly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>aside, to</i> <span class="smcap">Van B.</span>). I guess the air's got cooler up here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Charley. But if that girl imagines she's going to freeze <i>me</i>! (<i>Advancing
to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>) Why, my dear, it's almost too sweet for anything, meeting
you again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> You're extremely kind, Maud; I wish I could return the
compliment; but really, after what took place at Bellagio, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>taking her arm</i>). Well, I'll own up to being pretty horrid&mdash;and
so were you; but there don't seem any sense in our meeting up here
like a couple of strange cats on tiles. I won't fly out any more, there!
I'm just dying for a reconciliation; and so is Mr. Van Boodeler. The
trouble I've had to console that man! He never met anybody before
half so interested in the great Amurrcan Novel. And he's wearying for
another talk. So you'd better give that hatchet a handsome funeral,
and come along and take pity on him.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Hyp.</span>, <i>after a struggle, yields, half-reluctantly, and allows herself
to be taken across to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Van B.</span>, <i>who greets her effusively</i>.
<span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> <i>leaves them together</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> (<i>who has been prudently keeping in the background till now,
decides that his chance has come</i>). How do you do, Miss Trotter? It's
awfully jolly to meet you again like this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I guess that remark would have been more convincing
if you'd made it a few minutes earlier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;you see, I didn't know ... I was afraid&mdash;I rather
thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You don't get much further with <i>rather</i> thinking, as a
general rule, than if you didn't think at all. But if you're at all anxious to
run away the way you did at Bellagio, you needn't be afraid <i>I'll</i> hinder
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). Run away! <i>Do</i> you think I'd have gone if&mdash;I've
felt dull enough ever since, without <i>that!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Oh, I expect you've had a beautiful time. <i>We</i> have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>coming up</i>). Robert, I thought you wanted to see the Alps?
You should come over to the other side, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I'll undertake that he sees the Alps, my dear, presently&mdash;when
we're through our talk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> As you please, dear. But (<i>pointedly</i>) did I not see Mr.
Culchard below?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You don't mean to say you're wearied of Mr. Van Boodeler
<i>already</i>! Well, Mr. Culchard will be along soon, and I'll loan him to you.
I'll tell him you're vurry anxious to converse with him some more. He's
just coming along now, with Mr. Podbury and Poppa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>under her breath</i>). Maud! if you <i>dare</i>&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Don't you <i>dare</i> me, then&mdash;or you'll see. But I don't want to
be mean unless I'm obliged to.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Trotter</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>, <i>arrives at
the upper platform</i>. <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>efface themselves
as much as possible</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Trotter</span> <i>greets</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Prendergast</span> <i>heartily</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well now, I call this sociable, meeting all together again like
this. I don't see why in the land we didn't <i>keep</i> together. I've been
saying so to my darter here, ever since Bellagio&mdash;ain't that so, Maud?
And <i>she</i> didn't know just how it came about either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>). We&mdash;we had to be getting on. And I am afraid
we must say good-bye now, Mr. Trotter. I want Bob and Mr. Podbury to
see the Da Vinci fresco, you know, before the light goes. (<span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>mutters a
highly disrespectful wish concerning that work of Art</i>.) We <i>may</i> see you
again, before we leave for Verona.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Verona? Well, I don't care if I see Verona myself. Seems
a pity to separate now we <i>have</i> met, <i>don't</i> it? See here, now, we'll <i>all</i> go
along to Verona together&mdash;how's that, Maud? Start whenever <i>you</i> feel
like it, Miss Prendergast. How does that proposal strike you? I'll be
real hurt if you cann't take to my idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> The fact is, Poppa, Hypatia isn't just sure that Mr. Prendergast
wouldn't object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> I&mdash;object? Not <i>much</i>! Just what I should <i>like</i>, seeing
Verona with&mdash;all <i>together</i>, you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Then I guess <i>that's</i> fixed. (<i>Aside, to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>, <i>who is speechless</i>.)
Come, you haven't the heart to go and disappoint my poor Cousin
Charley by saying you won't go! I expect he'll be perfectly enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to be under vow&mdash;unless you've filled up <i>all</i> the vacancies already!
(<i>Aloud, to</i> <span class="smcap">Van B.</span>, <i>as he approaches</i>.) We've persuaded Miss Prendergast
to join our party. I hope you feel equal to entertaining her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van B.</span> I shall be proud to be permitted to try. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.</span>) Then
I may take it that you agree with me that the function of the future
American fictionist will be&mdash;&mdash;        [<i>They move away conversing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Culch.</span>). I say, old fellow, we're to be travelling companions
again, after all. And a jolly good thing, too, <i>I</i> think!... eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Oh, h'm&mdash;quite so. That is&mdash;but no doubt it will be an
advantage&mdash;(<i>with a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Van B.</span>, <i>who is absorbed in</i> <span class="smcap">Miss P.'s</span> <i>conversation</i>)&mdash;in&mdash;er&mdash;<i>some</i>
respects. (<i>To himself</i>) Hardly from poor dear
Podbury's point of view, I'm afraid though! However, if <i>he</i> sees
nothing&mdash;&mdash;!          [<i>He shrugs his shoulders, pityingly.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Tombs of the</i> <span class="smcap">Scaligers</span> <i>at Verona. A seedy and voluble
Cicerone, who has insisted upon volunteering his services, is accompanying</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span>, <span class="smcap">Bob Prendergast</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>. <i>It is
a warm afternoon, and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who has been intrusted with</i> <span class="smcap">Miss

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>bitterly, to the other two</i>). I <i>warned</i> you how it would be!
We shall have this sort of thing all the afternoon <i>now</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I don't mind; he's real polite and obliging&mdash;and

<p><span class="smcap">The Cic.</span> Sî-sì, Signore. Scultore Bonino da Campiglione. (<i>With

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> He's got an idea you find him vurry instructive, Mr. Culchard,
and I guess, if you want to disabuse him, you'd better do it in Italian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I think my Italian is equal to conveying an impression that

cent I had went on that old pot! Mr. Culchard, will you give him

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I&mdash;er&mdash;really see no necessity. He's done nothing whatever
to deserve it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). May <i>I</i>, Miss Trotter? (<i>Producing a ten-lire note.</i>)
This is the smallest change I've got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> No, I guess ten francs would start him with more self-respect
than he's got any use for. Mr. Culchard will give him three&mdash;that's one
apiece&mdash;to punish him for being so real mean!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Mean? because I&mdash;&mdash;! (<i>He pays and dismisses
the</i> <span class="smcap">Cic.</span>) Now we can examine these monuments in peace&mdash;they are
really&mdash;er&mdash;unique examples of the sepulchral pomp of Italian mediævalism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> They're handsome tombs enough&mdash;but considerable cramped.
I should have thought these old Scallywags would have looked around
for a roomier burying lot. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who shivers</i>.) You aren't
feeling sick any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> No&mdash;only pained by such a travesty of a noble name.
"Scallywags" for Scaligers seems to me, if I may say so, a very cheap
form of humour!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, it's more than cheap&mdash;it isn't going to cost you a cent,
so I should think you'd appreciate it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> Haw&mdash;score for <i>you</i>, Miss Trotter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I should have thought myself that mere personality is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
enough to give point to any repartee&mdash;there is a slight difference between
brilliancy and&mdash;er&mdash;<i>brutality</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> Hullo! You and I are being sat upon pretty heavily, Miss
Trotter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I guess our Schoolmaster's abroad. But why Mr. Culchard
should want to make himself a train out of my coverlets, I don't just see&mdash;he
looks majestic enough without that.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>catches up a blanket which is trailing, and says bad

<p class="center">AT THE TOMB OF JULIET.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>who is gradually recovering his equanimity</i>). Think of it!
the actual spot on which <i>Romeo</i> and <i>Juliet</i>&mdash;Shakspeare's <i>Juliet</i>&mdash;drew
their last breath! Does it not realise the tragedy for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, no&mdash;it's a disappointing tomb. I reckoned it would
look less like a horse-trough. I should have expected <i>Juliet's</i> Poppa and
Momma would want, considering all the facts of the case, to throw more
style into her monument!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>languidly</i>). May not its very simplicity&mdash;er&mdash;attest the
sincerity of their remorse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Do you attach any particular meaning to that observation
now? (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>bites his lip</i>.) I notice this tomb is full of visiting
cards&mdash;my! but ain't that curious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>instructively</i>). It only shows that this place is not without
its pathos and interest for <i>most</i> visitors, no matter what their nationality

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> To leave a pasteboard? Why I shouldn't sleep any all
night, for fear she'd return my call!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>producing a note-book</i>). It's fanciful, perhaps&mdash;but, if you
don't mind waiting a little, I should like to contribute&mdash;not my card, but
a sonnet. I feel one on its way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> Better make sure the tomb's <i>genuine</i> first, hadn't you? Some
say it <i>isn't</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>exasperated</i>). I <i>knew</i> you'd make some matter-of-fact remark
of that kind! There&mdash;it's no use! Let us go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Why, your sonnets seem as skeery as those lizards there!
I hope Juliet won't ever know what she's missed. But likely you'll mail
those verses on to her later.      [<i>She and</i> <span class="smcap">Bob P.</span> <i>pass on, laughing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>following</i>). She only affects this vulgar flippancy to torment
me. If I didn't know <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash; There, I've left that infernal pot behind
now!                [<i>Goes back for it, wrathfully.</i></p>

<p><i>In the Amphitheatre</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span>, <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Van
Boodeler</span>, <i>are seated on an upper tier</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>meditatively</i>). I suppose they charged highest for the lowest
seats. Wonder whether a lion ever nipped up and helped himself to some
fat old buffer in the Stalls when the martyrs turned out a leaner lot than
usual!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van B.</span> There's an ingenuous modernity about our friend's historical
speculations that is highly refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> There is, indeed&mdash;though he might have spared himself and
<i>us</i> the trouble of them if he had only remembered that the <i>podium</i> was
invariably protected by a railing, and occasionally by <i>euripi</i>, or trenches,
You surely learnt that at school, Mr. Podbury?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I&mdash;I dare say. Forgotten all I learnt at school, you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van B.</span> I should infer now, from that statement, that you enjoyed
the advantages of a pretty liberal education?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> If that's meant to be cutting, I should save it up for that
novel of yours; it may seem smart&mdash;<i>there</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Really, Mr. Podbury, if you choose to resent a playful
remark in that manner, you had better go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Perhaps I had. (<i>Rises, and moves off huffily.</i>) D&mdash;&mdash; his
playfulness! 'Pon my word, poor old Culchard was <i>nothing</i> to that
beggar! And she backs him up! But there&mdash;it's all part of my probation!
(<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>suddenly appears, laden with burdens</i>.) Hullo!
are you <i>moving</i>, or what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I am merely carrying a few things for Miss Trotter. (<i>Drops
the copper pot, which bounds down into the arena.</i>) Dash the thing!...
(<i>Returning with it.</i>) It's natural that, in my position, I should have these&mdash;er&mdash;privileges.
(<i>He trips over a blanket.</i>) Conf&mdash;&mdash;Have you happened
to see Miss Trotter about, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Fancy I saw her down below just now&mdash;with Bob. I expect
they're walking round under the arches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Just so. Do you know, Podbury, I almost think I'll go
down and find her. I&mdash;I'm curious to hear what her impressions of a
place like this are. Such a scene, you know,&mdash;so full of associations
with&mdash;er&mdash;the splendours and cruelties of a corrupt past&mdash;must produce
a powerful effect upon the fresh untutored mind of an American girl, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s</span> <i>voice</i> (<i>distinctly from arena</i>). I'd like ever so much to see
Buffalo Bill run his Show in here&mdash;he'd just make this old circus hum!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s</span> <i>voice</i> (<i>indistinctly from topmost tier</i>). Almost fancy it
all ... Senators&mdash;<i>equites</i>&mdash;<i>populus</i>&mdash;<i>pullati</i> ... yellow sunlight striking
down through <i>vellarium</i> ... crimsoned sand ... <i>mirmillo</i> fleeing before
<i>secutor</i> ... Diocletian himself, perhaps, lolling over there on <i>cubiculum</i> ...
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> The place appears to excite Miss Prendergast's enthusiasm,
at all events!            [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Rath-er! But then she's no end of a classical swell, you
know!                 [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>putting his arm through</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury's</span>). Ah, well, my dear
Podbury, one mustn't expect too much, must one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I <i>don't</i>, old chap&mdash;only I'm afraid <i>she</i> does. Suppose we
toddle back to the hotel, eh? Getting near <i>table d'hôte</i> time.      [<i>They go out arm-in-arm.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The interior of a covered gondola, which is conveying</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>from the Railway Station to the Hotel Dandolo, Venice.
The gondola is gliding with a gentle sidelong heave under shadowy
bridges of stone and cast-iron, round sharp corners, and past mysterious
blank walls, and old scroll-work gateways, which look ghostly in the moonlight.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>looking out of the felze window, and quoting conscientiously</i>).</p>

<p>
"I saw from out the wave her structures rise,<br />
As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> For rest, see guide-books, <i>passim</i>, eh? Hanged if <i>I</i> can see
any structures with this thing on, though! Let's have it off, eh? (<i>He
crawls out and addresses</i> <span class="smcap">Gondolier</span> <i>across the top.</i>) <i>Hi! Otez-moi ceci.
entendez-vous?</i> (<i>Drums on roof of felze with fists; the</i> <span class="smcap">Gondolier</span> <i>replies
in a torrent of Italian</i>.) Now a London cabby would see what I wanted
at once. This chap's a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> He probably imagines you are merely expressing your satisfaction
with Venice. And I don't see how you expect him to remove the
entire cabin here! (<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>crawls in again, knocking his head</i>.) I
think we did well to let the&mdash;the others travel on first. More <i>dignified</i>,
you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Um&mdash;don't see any particular dignity in missing the train,
myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> They won't know it was not intentional. And I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Podbury, we should go on&mdash;er&mdash;asserting ourselves a little while by holding
rather aloof. It will show them that we don't mean to put up with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;HI! OTEZ-MOI CECI!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Don't see that either. Not going to let that beast, Van
Boodeler, have it <i>all</i> his own way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Surely you know he decided suddenly to stay at Vicenza?
He said so at breakfast. But I will <i>not</i> have your friend Bob perpetually&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> At breakfast? Oh, I came down late. Vicenza, eh? Then
<i>he's</i> out of it! Hooray! But as for Bob, <i>he's</i> all right too. Oh, I forgot
you cut <i>déjeuner</i>. Hypatia had another squabble with Miss Trotter, and
poor old Bob got dragged into it as usual, and now they ain't on speaking
terms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>overjoyed</i>). You don't say so! Then all <i>I</i> can say, Podbury,
is that if we two can't manage, in a place like this, to recover all the
ground we have lost&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> More water than ground in a place like this, eh? But <i>I</i> know
what you mean&mdash;we <i>must</i> be duffers if we don't leave Venice engaged men&mdash;which
we're not as yet, worse luck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> No&mdash;but we <i>shall</i> be, if we only insist upon being treated
seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> She treats me a devilish deal <i>too</i> seriously, my boy. But there,
never mind&mdash;things will go better now!</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A double-bedded room in the Grand Hotel Dandolo, which</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>have to share for the night.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>from his bed, suspiciously, to</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who is setting fire to a
small pastille in a soap-dish</i>). I say, old chappie, bar <i>fireworks</i>, you
know! What the deuce <i>are</i> you up to over there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Lighting a "fidibus." Splendid thing to drive out mosquitoes.
(<i>The pastille fizzes, and begins to emit a dense white smoke, and
a suffocating odour.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>bounding</i>). Mosquitoes! It would drive a <i>dragon</i> out. Phew&mdash;ah!
(<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>closes the window</i>.) You <i>don't</i> mean to say you're
going to shut me up in this infernal reek on a stifling night like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I didn't, the mosquitoes would come in again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Come in? With that pastille doing the young Vesuvius!
<i>Do</i> you think a mosquito's a born fool? (<i>He jumps out and opens the
window.</i>) I'm not going to be smoked like a wasp's nest, <i>I</i> can tell
you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>calmly shutting it again, as</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>returns to bed</i>). You'll
be grateful to me by-and-by.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Slips between his mosquito curtains in a gingerly manner, and
switches off the electric light. A silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I say, you ain't asleep, are you? Think we shall see anything
of them to-morrow, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> See? I can <i>hear</i> one singing in my ear at this moment.
(<i>Irritably.</i>) You <i>would</i> open the window!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>sleepily</i>). Not mosquitoes. I meant Hypatia, and the&mdash;haw&mdash;yaw&mdash;Trotters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> How can <i>I</i> tell? (<i>Second silence.</i>) Podbury! What did I
<i>tell</i> you? One's just bitten me&mdash;the <i>beast</i>! (<i>He turns on the light, and
slaps about frantically</i>). I say, I can hear him buzzing all over the place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So can I hear <i>you</i> buzzing. How the dickens is a fellow to get
to sleep while you're playing Punch and Judy in there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> He's got me on the nose now! There's a lot outside. Just
turn off the light, will you? I daren't put my arm out. (<i>To</i> Mosquito.)
You brute! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Podb.</span>) Podbury, <i>do</i> switch off the light&mdash;like a good
fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>dreamily</i>). Glass up, Gondolier ... stifling in this cab ...
drive me ... nearest Doge.              [<i>He snores.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Brutal selfishness! (<i>Turns out the light himself.</i>) Now if I
can only get off to sleep while that little beast is quiet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosquito</span> (<i>ironically, in his ear</i>). Ping-a-wing-wing!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Same Scene; the next morning.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>drawing</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury's</span> <i>curtains</i>). Here, wake up, Podbury&mdash;it's
just eight. (<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>sits up, and rubs his eyes</i>.) I've had a <i>horrible</i> night,
my dear fellow! I'm stung to such an extent! But (<i>hopefully</i>) I suppose
there's nothing to <i>show</i> particularly, eh?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Presenting his countenance for inspection.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Not much of your original features, old fellow! (<i>He roars with
laughter.</i>) You've got a pair of cheeks like a raised map!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It&mdash;it's going <i>down</i>. Nothing to what it <i>was</i>, half an hour
ago!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Then I'm jolly glad you didn't call me earlier, that's all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It does feel a little inflamed. I wonder if I could get a little&mdash;er&mdash;violet
powder, or something&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a painful want of sympathy</i>). Violet powder! Buy a blue
veil&mdash;a good thick one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> What sort of impression <i>do</i> you suppose I should get of Venice
with a blue veil on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Can't say&mdash;but a pleasanter one than Venice will get of you
<i>without</i> it. You don't mean to face the fair Miss Trotter while you're like
<i>that</i>, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). Most certainly I <i>do</i>. I am much mistaken
in Miss Trotter if she will attach the slightest importance to a mere
temporary&mdash;er&mdash;disfigurement. These swellings never do last long.
<i>Do</i> they now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, not more than a month or so, I dare say, if you can keep
from touching them. (<i>He laughs again.</i>) Excuse me, old chap, but I just
got you in a new light. Those mosquitoes have paid you out for that
pastille&mdash;by Jove, they have!</p>

<p class="center">NINE A.M.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>coming out a little self-consciously, and finding</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Trotter</span>).
Ah, good morning! What are your&mdash;er&mdash;impressions of Venice, Mr.
Trotter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trotter</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). Well, I'm considerable struck with it,
Sir. There's a purrfect freshness and novelty about Vernis that's amusing
to a stranger like myself. We've nothing just like this city out West.
No, <i>Sir</i>. And how are&mdash;(<i>Becomes aware of</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard's</span> <i>appearance</i>.)
Say, <i>you</i> don't look like your slumbers had been one unbroken ca'm,
either! The mosquitoes hev been powerful active makin' alterations in
you. Perseverin' and industrious insects, Sir! Me and my darter have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
been for a loaf round before breakfast. I dunno if you've seen <i>her</i> yet,
she's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>coming out from behind</i>). Poppa, they've fixed up our
breakf&mdash;(<i>Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>and turns away, covering her face</i>). Don't you
turn your head in <i>this</i> direction, Mr. Culchard, or I guess I'll expire right
away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>obeying, wounded</i>). I confess I did <i>not</i> think a few mosquito-bites
would have quite such an effect upon you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You're vurry polite, I'm sure! But I possess a hand-mirror;
and, if you cann't bear to look me in the face, you'd better keep away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>takes a hasty glance, and discovers, with a shock, that she is
almost as much disfigured as himself</i>). Oh, I&mdash;I wasn't&mdash;&mdash;(<i>With an effort
of politeness.</i>) Er&mdash;I hope <i>you</i> haven't been inconvenienced at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Inconvenienced! With haff a dozen healthy mosquitoes
springing a surprise party on me all night! I should guess <i>so</i>. (<i>Noticing</i>
<span class="smcap">C.'s</span> <i>face</i>.) But what in the land have you been about? Well, if that
isn't real <i>tact</i> now! I reckoned I'd been dealt a full hand in spots; but
now I've seen you, I guess there's a straight flush against me, and I can
just throw up. But you don't play Poker, <i>do</i> you? Come along in,
Poppa, do.               [<i>She goes in with</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>alone, disenchanted</i>). I could <i>not</i> have believed any amount
of bites could have made such a terrible difference in her. She looks

looking expectantly down the Grand Canal</i>, <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is leaning upon
the Balustrade</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Yes, met Bob just now. They've gone to the Europa, but
we've arranged to take a gondola together, and go about. They're
to pick me up here. Ah, that looks rather like them. (<i>A gondola
approaches, with</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Prendergast</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span>; <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>goes down the

you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>ignoring</i> <span class="smcap">C.'s</span> <i>salute</i>). How do you do, Mr. Podbury?
Surely you don't propose to go out in a gondola in <i>that</i> hat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>taking off a brown "pot-hat," and inspecting it</i>). It&mdash;it's quite
<i>decent</i>. It was new when I came away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> (<i>who is surly this morning</i>). Hang it all, Patia! Do you want
him to come out in a chimney-pot? Jump in, old fellow, never mind
your tile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>apologetically</i>). I had a straw once&mdash;but I sat on it. I'm
awfully sorry, Miss Prendergast. Look here, shall I go and see if I can
buy one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Not now&mdash;it doesn't signify, for once. But a round hat
and a gondola are really <i>too</i> incongruous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Are they? A lot of the Venetians seem to wear 'em. (<i>He
steps in.</i>) Now what are we going to do&mdash;just potter about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> One hardly comes to Venice to <i>potter</i>! I thought we'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
go and study the Carpaccios at the Church of the Schiavoni first&mdash;they
won't take us more than an hour or so; then cross to
San Giorgio Maggiore, and see the Tintorets, come back and get a
general idea of the exterior of St. Mark's, and spend the afternoon at the
Accademia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a slight absence of heartiness</i>). Capital! And&mdash;er&mdash;lunch
at the Academy, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> There does not happen to be a restaurant there&mdash;we shall
see what time we have. I must say <i>I</i> regard every minute of daylight
spent on food here as a sinful waste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Now just look here, Patia, if you <i>are</i> bossing this show, you
needn't go cutting us off our grub! What do <i>you</i> say, Jem?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>desperately anxious to please</i>). Oh, I don't know that I care
about lunch myself&mdash;much.      [<i>Their voices die away on the water.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>musing</i>). She might have <i>bowed</i> to me!... <i>She</i> has escaped
the mosquitoes.... Ah, well, I doubt if she'll find those two particularly
sympathetic companions! Now I <i>should</i> enjoy a day spent in that way.
Why shouldn't I, as it is? I dare say Maud will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

cheeks&mdash;they've swelled up again some. I guess you want to Cologne
<i>your</i> cheeks&mdash;they're dreadful lumpy. I've just been on the Pi-azza
again, Sir. It's curious now the want of enterprise in these Vernetians.
Any one would have expected they'd have thrown a couple or so of
girder bridges across the canal between this and the Ri-alto, and run an
elevator up the Campanile&mdash;but this ain't what you might call a

Hello, Maud, the ice-water cool down your face any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Not <i>much</i>. My face just made that ice-water boil over.
I don't believe I'll ever have a complexion again&mdash;it's divided up among
several dozen mosquitoes, who've no use for one. But it's vurry consoling
to look at <i>you</i>, Mr. Culchard, and feel there's a pair of us. Now what
way do you propose we should endeavour to forget our sufferings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Then shall we just drift about in a gondola all the morning,
and&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps do the Academy later?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Not any canals in this hot sun for me! I'd be just as
<i>sick</i>! That gondola will keep till it's cooler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>losing patience</i>). Then I must really leave it to you to
make a suggestion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I believe I'll have a good look round the curiosity
stores. There's ever such a cunning little shop back of the Clock Tower
on the Pi-azza, where I saw some brocades that were just too sweet!
So I'll take Poppa along bargain-hunting. Don't <i>you</i> come if you'd
rather poke around your old churches and things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I don't feel disposed to&mdash;er&mdash;"poke around" alone, so, if
you will allow me to accompany you,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Oh, I'll allow you to escort me. It's handy having some one
around to carry parcels. And Poppa's bound to drop the balance every
time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). That's all I am to her. A beast of burden!
And a whole precious morning squandered on this confounded shopping&mdash;when
I might have been&mdash;ah, well!</p>

day of it, you know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well, now, I declare I sort of recognised those voices!

<blockquote><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> <i>presents a stony silence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> There! Dumned if I didn't clean forget you were out!
But, see here, now&mdash;why cann't we let bygones be bygones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>impulsively</i>). Just what <i>I</i> think, Mr. Trotter, and I'm sure
my sister will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Bob, will you kindly not make the situation more awkward
than it is? If I desired a reconciliation, I think I am quite capable of
saying so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>in confidence to the Moon</i>). This Ark isn't proposing to
send out any old dove, either&mdash;we've no use for an olive-branch. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. T</span>.) That's "<i>Santa Lucia</i>" they're singing now, Poppa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> They don't appear to me to get the twist on it they did
at Bellagio!</p>

Poor Charley! he'd just love to be here&mdash;he's ever so much artistic
feeling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well, I don't see why he couldn't have come along if he'd
wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>with a glance at her neighbour</i>). I presume he'd reasons
enough. He's a vurry cautious man. Likely he was afraid he'd get bitten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>after a swift scrutiny of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss T.'s</span> <i>features</i>). Oh, Bob,
remind me to get some more of that mosquito stuff. I <i>should</i> so hate
to be bitten&mdash;such a <i>dreadful</i> disfigurement!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Some people are hardly recognisable, Bob, and they say
the marks never <i>quite</i> disappear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Poppa, don't you wonder what Charley's doing just now?
I'd like to know if he's found any one yet to feel an interest in the great
Amurrcan Novel. It's curious how interested people do get in that
novel, considering it's none of it written, and never will be. I guess
sometimes he makes them believe he means something by it. They
don't understand it's only Charley's way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> The crush isn't quite so bad now. Mr. Podbury, if you
will kindly ask your friend not to hold on to our gondola, we should
probably be better able to turn. (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span>, <i>who had fondly imagined

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I do just enjoy making that Prendergast girl perfectly
wild, and that's a fact. (<i>Reflectively.</i>) And it's queer, but I like her

<h3>One Man's Meat; another Man's Poison.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Campo S. S. Giovanni e Paulo. Afternoon.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>is
leaning against the pedestal of the Colleoni Statue</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury.</span> (<i>who has just come out of S. Giovanni, recognising</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>).
Hullo! <i>alone</i>, eh? Thought you were with Miss Trotter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard.</span> So I am. That is, she is going over a metal-worker's
show-room close by, and I&mdash;er&mdash;preferred the open air. But didn't you
say you were going out with the&mdash;er&mdash;Prendergasts again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So I am. She's in the Church with Bob, so I said I'd come
out and keep an eye on the gondola. Nothing much to see in <i>there</i>, you
know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a weary irony</i>). Only the mausoleums of the Doges&mdash;Ruskin's
"Street of the Tombs"&mdash;and a few trifles of that sort!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> That's all. And I'm feeling a bit done, you know. Been
doing the Correr Museum all the morning, and not lunched yet! So Miss
Trotter's looking at ornamental metal-work? Rather fun that, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> For those who enjoy it. She has only been in there an hour,
so she is not likely to come back just yet. What do you say to coming
into S. S. Giovanni e Paulo again, with <i>me</i>? Those tombs form a really
remarkable illustration, as Ruskin points out, of the gradual decay of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> (<i>suddenly flutters up, followed by an attendant carrying
a studded halberd, an antique gondola-hook, and two copper water-buckets&mdash;all
of which are consigned to the disgusted</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>). Just hold these a
spell till I come back. Thanks ever so much.... Well, Mr. Podbury!
Aren't you going to admire my purchases? They're real antique&mdash;or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they aren't, they'll wear all the better.... There, I believe I'll just have
to run back a minute&mdash;don't you put those things in the gondola yet,
Mr. Culchard, or they'll get stolen.          [<i>She flutters off.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>helplessly, as he holds the halberd, &amp;c.</i>). I suppose I shall
have to stay <i>here</i> now. You're not going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>consulting his watch</i>). Must. Promised old Bob I'd relieve
guard in ten minutes. Ta-ta.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He goes</i>; <i>presently</i> <span class="smcap">Bob Prendergast</span> <i>lounges out of the church</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I could only make a friend of <i>him</i>! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.) Ah,
Prendergast! lovely afternoon, isn't it? Delicious breeze!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> (<i>shortly</i>). Can't say. Not had much of it, at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You find these old churches rather oppressive, I dare say.
Er&mdash;will you have a cigarette?            [<i>Tenders case.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Thanks; got a pipe. (<i>He lights it.</i>) Where's Miss Trotter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> She will be here presently. By the way, my dear Prendergast,
this&mdash;er&mdash;misunderstanding between your sister and her is very
unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> I know that well enough. It's none of <i>my</i> doing! And <i>you</i>'ve
no reason to complain, at all events!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Quite so. Only, you see, we <i>used</i> to be good friends at
Constance, and&mdash;er&mdash;until recently&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Used we? Of course, if you say so, it's all right. But what are
you driving at exactly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> All I am driving at is this: Couldn't we two&mdash;er&mdash;agree to
effect a reconciliation between the two ladies? So much pleasanter for&mdash;er&mdash;all
parties!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> I dare say. But how are you going to set about it? <i>I</i> can't
begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Couldn't you induce your sister to lay aside her&mdash;er&mdash;prejudice
against me? Then <i>I</i> could easily&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Very likely&mdash;but I <i>couldn't</i>. I never interfere in my sister's
affairs, and, to tell you the honest truth, I don't feel particularly inclined
to make a beginning on your account.         [<i>Strolls away.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). What a surly boor it is! But I don't care&mdash;I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
do him a good turn, in spite of himself! (<span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> <i>returns</i>.) Do you
know, I've just been having a chat with poor young Prendergast. He
seems quite cut up at being forced to side with his sister. I undertook
to&mdash;er&mdash;intercede for him. Now is it quite fair, or like your&mdash;er&mdash;usual
good-nature, to visit his sister's offences&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;on him?
I&mdash;I only put it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, to think now! I guess you're about the most unselfish
saint on two legs! Now some folks would have felt jealous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Possibly&mdash;but I cannot accuse myself of such a failing as
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I'd just like to hear you accuse yourself of <i>any</i> failing! I
don't see however you manage to act so magnanimous and live. I told
you I wanted to study your character, and I believe it isn't going to take
me vurry much longer to make up my mind about <i>you</i>. You <i>don't</i>
suppose I'll have any time for Mr. Prendergast after getting such a
glimpse into your nature? There, help me into the gondola, and don't
talk any more about it. Tell him to go to Salviate's right away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>dejectedly to himself</i>). I've bungled it! I might have <i>known</i>
I should only make matters worse!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>On the Piazzetta; it is moonlight, the Campanile and dome of San Giorgio
Maggiore are silhouetted sharp and black against the steel-blue sky across
a sea of silver ripples.</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>are pacing slowly
arm-in-arm between the two columns</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> And so you went on to S. Giovanni in Bragora, eh? then
over the Arsenal, and rowed across the lagoons to see the Armenian
convent? A delightful day, my dear Podbury! I hope you&mdash;er&mdash;appreciate
the inestimable privileges of&mdash;of seeing Venice so thoroughly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, of course it's very jolly. Find I get a trifle mixed afterwards,
though. And, between ourselves, I wouldn't mind&mdash;now and then,
you know&mdash;just dawdling about among the shops and people, as you and
the Trotters do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> That has its charm, no doubt. But don't you find Miss
Prendergast a mine of information on Italian Art and History?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Don't I just&mdash;rather too <i>deep</i> for me, y' know! I say, isn't
Miss Trotter immense sport in the shops and that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> She is&mdash;er&mdash;vivacious, certainly. (<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>sighs</i>.) You
seem rather dull to-night, my dear fellow?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Not dull&mdash;a trifle out of sorts, that's all. Fact is, I don't think
Venice agrees with me. All this messing about down beastly back-courts
and canals and in stuffy churches&mdash;it <i>can't</i> be healthy, you know! And
they've <i>no</i> drainage. I only hope I haven't caught something, as it is.
I've that kind of sinking feeling, and a general lowness&mdash;<i>She</i> says I lunch
too heavily&mdash;but I swear it's more than that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Nonsense, you're well enough. And why you should feel
low, with all your advantages&mdash;in Venice as you are, and in constant
intercourse with a mind adorned with every feminine gift&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Hul-lo! why, I thought you called her a pedantic prig?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If I used such a term at all, it was in no disparaging sense.
Every earnest nature presents an&mdash;er&mdash;priggish side at times. I know
that even I myself have occasionally, and by people who didn't <i>know</i> me
of course, been charged with priggishness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Have you, though? But of course there's nothing of that
about <i>her</i>. Only&mdash;well, it don't signify.          [<i>He sighs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Ah, Podbury, take the good the gods provide you and be
content! You might be worse off, believe me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>discontentedly</i>). It's all very well for <i>you</i> to talk&mdash;with Miss
Trotter all to yourself. I suppose you're regularly engaged by this
time, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Not quite. There's still a&mdash;&mdash; And your probation, that's
practically at an end?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I don't know. Can't make her out. She wouldn't sit on
me the way she does unless she <i>liked</i> me, I suppose. But I say, it
must be awf&mdash;rather jolly for you with Miss Trotter? She's got so
much <i>go</i>, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You used to say she wasn't what you call cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I know I did. That's just what I like about her! At least&mdash;well,
we <i>both</i> ought to think ourselves uncommonly lucky beggars, I'm
sure!              [<i>He sighs more heavily than ever.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> You especially, my dear Podbury. In fact, I doubt if you're
half grateful enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>snappishly</i>). Yes, I am, I tell you. <i>I</i>'m not grumbling, am I?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I know as well as you do she's miles too good for me. Haven't I <i>said</i>
so? Then what the devil do you keep on nagging at me for, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I am glad you see it in that light. Aren't you a little
irritable to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> No, I'm not. It's those filthy canals. And the way you
talk&mdash;as if a girl like Miss Trotter wasn't&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I really can't allow you to lecture me. I am not insensible
to my good-fortune&mdash;if others are. Now we'll drop the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I'm willing enough to drop it. And I shall turn in now&mdash;it's

golden ribs to all its leaves."&mdash;Do you see the ribs, Mr. Podbury?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>feebly</i>). Y&mdash;yes. I <i>believe</i> I do. Think they grew that sort
of fig-tree formerly, or is it&mdash;a&mdash;<i>allegorical</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> (<i>receiving this query in crushing silence</i>). The ceiling requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
careful study. Look at that oblong panel in the centre&mdash;with the fiery
serpents, which Ruskin finely compares to "winged lampreys." You're
not looking in the right way to see them, Mr. Podbury!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>faintly</i>). I&mdash;I did see them&mdash;<i>all</i> of them, on my honour I
did! But it gives me such a crick in my neck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Surely Tintoret is worth a crick in the neck. Did you
observe "the intense delight in biting expressed in their eyes"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>frivolously</i>). <i>I</i> did, 'Patia&mdash;exactly the same look I observed

<p><span class="smcap">The Stout Lady.</span> Now, Ethel, we can just spend ten minutes on

oval (<i>referring to plan</i>). Yes, I thought so,&mdash;it <i>is</i> Jonah. Ruskin considers
"the whale's tongue much too large, unless it is a kind of crimson
cushion for Jonah to kneel upon." Well, why <i>not</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> A cushion, Mother? what, <i>inside</i> the whale!</p>

Ruskin points out (<i>reading</i>) "A very sweet incident. Four or five sheep,
instead of pasturing, turn their heads to catch the manna as it comes
down" (<i>here</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>catches</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury's</span> <i>eye</i>), "or seem to be licking it off

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Bob, go on and get the gondola ready. I wish to speak to
Mr. Podbury. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>, <i>after</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>has withdrawn</i>.) Mr. Podbury,
I cannot tell you how disgusted and disappointed I feel at your senseless
irreverence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>penitently</i>). I&mdash;I'm really most awfully sorry&mdash;but it came
over me suddenly, and I simply couldn't help myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> That is what makes it so very hopeless&mdash;after all the pains
I have taken with you! I have been beginning to fear for some time
that you are incorrigible&mdash;and to-day is really the <i>last</i> straw! So it is
kinder to let you know at once that you have been tried and found
wanting. I have no alternative but to release you finally from your vows&mdash;I
cannot allow you to remain my suitor any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>humbly</i>). I was always afraid I shouldn't last the course,
don't you know. I did my best&mdash;but it wasn't <i>in</i> me, I suppose. It was
awfully good of you to put up with me so long. And, I say, you won't
mind our being friends still, will you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Of course not. I shall always wish you well, Mr. Podbury&mdash;only
I won't trouble you to accompany me to any more galleries!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> A&mdash;thanks. I&mdash;I mean, I know I should only be in your way
and all that. And&mdash;I'd better say good-bye, Miss Prendergast. You won't
want me in the gondola just now, I'm sure. I can easily get another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.</span> Well&mdash;good-bye then, Mr. Podbury. I will explain to Bob.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She steps into the gondola</i>; <span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>raises his eyebrows in mute

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>to himself as the gondola disappears</i>). So <i>that's</i> over! Hanged if
I don't think I'm sorry, after all. It will be beastly lonely without anybody
to bully me, and she could be awfully nice when she chose.... Still it <i>is</i>
a relief to have got rid of old Tintoret, and not to have to bother about
Bellini and Cima and that lot.... How that beggar Culchard will crow
when he hears of it! Shan't tell him anything&mdash;if I can help it....
But the worst of getting the sack is&mdash;people are almost <i>bound</i> to spot
you.... I think I'll be off to-morrow. I've had enough of Venice!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PILGRIMS OF LOVE.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Piazza of St. Mark at night. The roof and part of the
façade gleam a greenish silver in the moonlight. The shadow of
the Campanile falls, black and broad, across the huge square, which
is crowded with people listening to the Military Band, and taking
coffee, &amp;c., outside the cafés.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trotter</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>are
seated at one of the little tables in front of the Quadri</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> I'd like ever so much to know why it is you're so
anxious to see that Miss Prendergast and me friendly again? After
she's been treating you this long while like you were a toad&mdash;and
not a popular kind of toad at that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>wincing</i>). Of course I am only too painfully aware of&mdash;of
a certain distance in her manner towards me, but I should not think
of allowing myself to be influenced by any&mdash;er&mdash;merely personal considerations
of that sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> That's real noble! And I presume, now, you cann't
imagine any reason why she's been treading you so flat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a shrug</i>). I really haven't troubled to speculate. Who
can tell how one may, quite unconsciously, give offence&mdash;even to those
who are&mdash;er&mdash;comparative strangers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Just so. (<i>A pause.</i>) Well, Mr. Culchard, if I wanted
anything to confirm my opinion of you, I guess you've given it me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>internally</i>). It's very unfortunate that she <i>will</i> insist on
idealizing me like this!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Maybe, now, you can form a pretty good idea already
what that opinion is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>in modest deprecation</i>). You give me some reason for
inferring that it is far higher than I deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I don't know that you've missed your guess
altogether. Are you through your ice-cream yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Almost. (<i>He finishes his ice.</i>) It is really most refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Then, now you're refreshed, I'll tell you what I think
about you. (<span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>resigns himself to enthusiasm</i>.) My opinion
of you, Mr. Culchard, is that, taking you by and large, you amount
to what we Amurrcans describe as "a pretty mean cuss."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>genuinely surprised</i>). A mean cuss? Me! Really, this
unjustifiable language is <i>most</i>&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, I don't just know what your dictionary term would
be for a man who goes and vows exclusive devotion to one young
lady, while he's waiting for his answer from another, and keeps his
head close shut to each about it. Or a man who backs out of his
vows by trading off the sloppiest kind of flap-doodle about not wishing
to blight the hopes of his dearest friend. Or a man who has been
trying his hardest to get into the good graces again of the young
lady he went back on first, so he can cut out that same dearest friend
of his, and leave the girl he's haff engaged to right out in the cold.
And puts it all off on the high-toned-est old sentiments, too. But
I don't consider the expression, "a mean cuss," too picturesque for
that particular kind of hero myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>breathing hard</i>). Your feelings have apparently undergone
a sudden change&mdash;quite recently!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Well, no, the change dates back considerable&mdash;ever since we
were at the Villa d'Este. Only, I like Mr. Podbury pretty well, and I
allowed he ought to have fair play, so I concluded I'd keep you around
so you shouldn't get a chance of spoiling your perfectly splendid act of
self-denial&mdash;and I guess I've <i>kept</i> you around pretty much all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>bitterly</i>). In other words, you have behaved like a heartless
coquette!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> You may put it at that if you like. Maybe it wouldn't
have been just the square thing to do if you'd been a different sort
of man&mdash;but you wanted to be taught that you couldn't have all the
fun of flirtation on <i>your</i> side, and I wasn't afraid the emotional strain
was going to shatter you up to any serious extent. Now it's left off
amusing me, and I guess it's time to stop. I'm as perfectly aware as
I can be that you've been searching around for some way of getting
out of it this long while back&mdash;so there's no use of your denying
you'll be real enchanted to get your liberty again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I may return your charming candour by admitting that
my&mdash;er&mdash;dismissal will be&mdash;well, not wholly without its consolations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Then <i>that's</i> all right! And if you'll be obliging enough
to hunt up my Poppa and send him along, I guess I can dispense with
your further escort, and you can commence those consolations right
away.</p>

and took care to strike first. Clever&mdash;but a trifle crude. But I'm free
now. Unfortunately my freedom comes too late. Podbury's <i>Titania</i>
is much too enamoured of those ass's ears of his&mdash;&mdash;How the brute
will chuckle when he hears of this! But he won't hear of it from <i>me</i>.

congratulate you on better luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> On precisely similar luck. Miss Trotter and I&mdash;er&mdash;arrived
at the conclusion last night that we were not formed to make each
other's happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Did you, by Jove? Porter, I say, never mind about that

Shan't leave to-day, after all. I shall just nip over and see what

<h3>JOURNEYS END IN LOVERS' MEETING.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Near Torcello.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>are seated side by side
in the gondola, which is threading its way between low banks, bright
with clumps of Michaelmas daisies and pomegranate-trees laden with
red fruit. Both</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>are secretly nervous and
anxious for encouragement</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Podbury</span> (<i>humming</i> "<i>In Old Madrid</i>" <i>with sentiment</i>). La-doodle-um-La-doodle-oo:
La-doodle-um-te-dumpty-loodle-oo! I think she rather
seemed to like me&mdash;those first days at Brussels, don't <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culchard</span> (<i>absently</i>). Did she? I dare say. (<i>Whistling</i> "<i>The
Wedding March</i>" <i>softly</i>.) Few-fee; di-fee-fee-few-few; few-fiddledy-fee-fiddledy-few-few-few-fee.
I fancy I'm right in my theory, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, I should say so&mdash;yes. <i>What</i> theory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). What theory? Why, the one I've been explaining
to you for the last ten minutes!&mdash;that all this harshness of hers lately is
really, when you come to analyse it, a decidedly encouraging symptom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> But I shouldn't have said Miss Trotter was exactly <i>harsh</i> to
me&mdash;lately, at all events.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with impatience</i>). Miss Trotter! You! What an egoist you
are, my dear fellow! I was referring to myself and Miss Prendergast.
And you can't deny that, both at Nuremberg and Constance, she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with careless optimism</i>). Oh, <i>she</i>'ll come round all right, never
fear. I only wish I was half as safe with Miss Trotter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>mollified</i>). Don't be too down-hearted, my dear Podbury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I happen to know that she likes you&mdash;she told me as much last night.
Did Miss Prendergast&mdash;er&mdash;say anything to that effect about <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Well,&mdash;not exactly, old chap&mdash;not to me, at least. But I say,
Miss Trotter didn't tell you <i>that</i>? Not <i>really</i>? Hooray! Then it's all
right&mdash;she may have me after all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>chillingly</i>). I should advise you not to be over-confident.
(<i>A silence follows, which endures until they reach the landing-steps at
Torcello.</i>) They <i>are</i> here, you see&mdash;those are evidently their gondolas, I
recognise those two cloaks. Now the best thing <i>we</i> can do is to separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>springing out</i>). Right you are! (<i>To himself.</i>) I'll draw the
church first and see if she's there. (<i>Approaches the door of Santa Maria:
a Voice within, apparently reading aloud</i>: "<i>Six balls, or rather almonds, of
purple marble veined with white are set around the edge of the pulpit, and
form its only decoration</i>.") Hypatia, by Jove! Narrow shave that!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He goes round to back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>comes up to the door</i>). I know I shall find her here. Lucky
I know that Torcello chapter in "The Stones" very nearly by heart!
(<i>Reaches threshold. A Voice within.</i> "<i>Well, I guess I'm going to climb up
and sit in that old amphitheatre there, and see how it feels</i>!") Good
heavens,&mdash;<i>Maud</i>! and I was as nearly as possible&mdash;I think I'll go up to
the top of the Campanile and see if I can't discover where Hypatia is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> It's quite impossible to make them hear down there, and it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
no fault of ours if their voices reach us occasionally. And it <i>does</i> seem to
me, Podbury, that, in a matter which may be of vital importance to me&mdash;to
us both&mdash;it would be absurd to be over-scrupulous. But of course you
will please yourself. <i>I</i> intend to remain where I am.      [<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>reluctantly resigns himself to the situation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> Now, Hypatia Prendergast, don't tell <i>me</i> you're not
interested in him! And he's more real suited to you than ever Mr.
Podbury was. Now, isn't that <i>so</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>withdrawing his head</i>). Did you hear, Podbury? She's
actually pleading for me! <i>Isn't</i> she an angel? Be quiet, now. I must
hear the answer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> I&mdash;I don't know, really. But, Maud, I want to speak to
you about&mdash;Somebody. You can't think how he adores you, poor fellow!
I have noticed it for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pobd.</span> (<i>beaming</i>). Culchard! You heard? She's putting in a word
for me. What a brick that girl is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> I guess he's pretty good at concealing his feelings, then.
He's been keeping far enough away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s V.</span> That was <i>my</i> fault. I <i>kept</i> him by me. You see, I
believed you had quite decided to accept Mr. Culchard.</p>

<p>Miss T.'s V. Well, it does strike me that, considering he was adoring
me all this time, he let himself be managed tolerable easy.      [<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>shakes his head in protestation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s V.</span> Ah, but let me explain. I could only keep him quiet by
threatening to go home by myself, and dear Bob is such a devoted brother
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pobd.</span> Brother! I say, Culchard, she can't be meaning <i>Bob</i> all this
time! She <i>can't</i>! can she now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> How on earth can <i>I</i> tell? If it is so, you must be a
philosopher, my dear fellow, and bear it&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s V.</span> That <i>does</i> alter the case, doesn't it? And I may tell him
there's some hope for him? You mustn't judge him by what he is with his
friend, Mr. Podbury. Bob has such a <i>much</i> stronger and finer character!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> Oh well, if he couldn't stand up more on his edge than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Mr. Podbury! Not that I mind Mr. Podbury any, there's no harm in
him, but he's too real frivolous to amount to much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>collapsing</i>). Frivolous! From <i>her</i> too! Oh, hang it <i>all</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He buries his head in his hands with a groan.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> Well, see here, Hypatia. I'll take your brother on trial
for a spell, to oblige you&mdash;there. I cann't say more at present. And
now&mdash;about the other. I want to know just how you feel about him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> The <i>other</i>!&mdash;that's Me! I wish to goodness you wouldn't
make all that noise, Podbury, just when it's getting interesting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s V.</span> (<i>very low</i>). What is the good! Nothing will bring him
back&mdash;<i>now</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Nothing? How little she knows me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> I hope you don't consider <i>me</i> nothing. And a word
from me would bring him along pretty smart. The only question is
whether I'm to say it or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> (<i>muffled</i>). Dar-ling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I really think I might almost venture to go down now, eh,
Podbury? (<i>No answer.</i>) Selfish brute!      [<i>Indignantly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> But mind this&mdash;if he comes back, you've got to care for
him the whole length of your boa&mdash;you won't persuade him to run in
couples with anybody else. That's why he broke away the first time&mdash;and
you were ever so mad with me because you thought I was at the bottom
of it. But it was all his pride. He's too real independent to share
chances with anybody alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> How thoroughly she understands me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> And I guess Charley will grow out of the great Amurrcan
Novel in time&mdash;it's not going ever to grow out of <i>him</i>, anyway!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>bewildered</i>). Charley? I don't see why she should mention
Van Boodeler <i>now</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> I like Charley ever so much, and I'm not going to have
him cavort around along with a circus of suitors under vows. So, if I
thought there was any chance of&mdash;well, say Mr. Culchard&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss P.'s V.</span> (<i>indignant</i>). Maud! how <i>can</i> you? That odious hypocritical
creature! If you knew how I despised and&mdash;&mdash;!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.'s V.</span> Well, my dear, he's pretty paltry&mdash;but we'll let him go at
that&mdash;I guess his shares have gone down considerable all round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Podbury, I&mdash;I&mdash;this conversation is evidently not intended
for&mdash;for other ears&mdash;I don't know whether <i>you</i> have heard enough, <i>I</i> shall
go down!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with a ghastly chuckle</i>). Like your shares, eh, old chap? And
mine too, for that matter. Well, <i>I'm</i> ready enough to go. Only, for
goodness' sake, let's get away without being seen!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>They slip softly down the series of inclined planes, and out to the

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Why, land sakes! ain't that Mr. Podbury and Mr. Culchard?
Hi! you ain't ever going away? There's my darter and Miss Hypatia
around somewhere&mdash;They'll be dreadful disappointed to have missed you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>with an heroic attempt at cheeriness</i>). We&mdash;we're awfully
disappointed to have missed <i>them</i>, Mr. Trotter. Afraid we can't stop now!
Good-bye!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>Podbury Kisses the Rod.</h3>


<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>On the Lagoons.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury's</span> <i>gondola is nearing
Venice. The apricot-tinted diaper on the façade of the Ducal Palace
is already distinguishable, and behind its battlements the pearl-grey
domes of St. Mark's shimmer in the warm air.</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>have hardly exchanged a sentence as yet. The former has
just left off lugubriously whistling as much as he can remember of</i>
"<i>Che faro</i>," <i>the latter is still humming</i> "<i>The Dead March in Saul</i>,"
<i>although in a livelier manner than at first</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, my dear Podbury, our&mdash;er&mdash;expedition has turned
out rather disastrously!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>suspending the</i> "<i>Dead March</i>," <i>chokily</i>). Not much mistake
about <i>that</i>&mdash;but there, it's no good talking about it. Jolly that brown
and yellow sail looks on the fruit barge there. See?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>sardonically</i>). Isn't it a little late in the day to be cultivating
an eye for colour? I was about to say that those two girls have
treated us infamously. I say deliberately, my dear Podbury, <i>infamously</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Now drop it, Culchard, do you hear? I won't hear a word
against either of them. It serves us jolly well right for not knowing
our own minds better&mdash;though I no more dreamed that old Bob would&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
hang it, I can't talk about it yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> That's childishness, my dear fellow; you <i>ought</i> to talk
about it&mdash;it will do you good. And really, I'm not at all sure, after
all, that we have not both of us had a fortunate escape. One is very
apt to&mdash;er&mdash;overrate the fascinations of persons one meets abroad.
Now neither of those two was <i>quite</i>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>desperately</i>). Take care! I swear I'll pitch you out of this
gondola, unless you stop that jabber!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with wounded dignity</i>). I am willing to make allowance
for your state of mind, Podbury, but such an expression as&mdash;as <i>jabber</i>,
applied to my&mdash;er&mdash;well-meant attempts at consolation, and just as I
was about to propose an arrangement&mdash;really, it's <i>too</i> much! The
moment we reach the hotel, I will relieve you from any further infliction
from (<i>bitterly</i>) what you are pleased to call my "jabber"!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). Very well&mdash;I'm sure <i>I</i> don't care! (<i>To himself.</i>)
Even old Culchard won't have anything to do with me now! I must
have <i>somebody</i> to talk to&mdash;or I shall go off my head! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I say,
old <i>chap</i>! (<i>No answer.</i>) Look here&mdash;it's bad enough as it is without
<i>our</i> having a row! Never mind anything I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I <i>do</i> mind&mdash;I <i>must</i>. I am not accustomed to hear myself
called a&mdash;a <i>jabberer</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I <i>didn't</i> call you a jabberer&mdash;I only said you <i>talked</i> jabber.
I&mdash;I hardly know what I <i>do</i> say, when I'm like this. And I'm deuced
sorry I spoke&mdash;there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>relaxing</i>). Well, do you withdraw jabber?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Certainly, old chap. I <i>like</i> you to talk, only not&mdash;not
against Her, you know! What were you going to propose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, my idea was this. My leave is practically unlimited&mdash;at
least, without vanity, I think I may say that my Chief
sufficiently appreciates my services not to make a fuss about a few
extra days. So I thought I'd just run down to Florence and Naples,
and perhaps catch a P. &amp; O. at Brindisi. I suppose <i>you're</i> not tied to
time in any way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>dolefully</i>). Free as a bird! If the Governor had wanted
me back in the City, he'd have let me know it. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Well, if you like to come with me, I&mdash;I shall be very pleased
to have your company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>considering</i>). I don't care if I do&mdash;it may cheer me up a bit.
Florence, eh?&mdash;and Naples? I shouldn't mind a look at Florence.
Or Rome. How about Rome, now?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Was I wise to expose myself to this sort of
thing <i>again</i>? I'm almost sorry I&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) My dear fellow, if we
are to travel together in any sort of comfort, you must leave all details
to <i>me</i>. And there's one thing I <i>do</i> insist on. In future we must keep
to our original resolution&mdash;not to be drawn into any chance acquaintanceship.
I don't want to reproach you, but if, when we were first
at Brussels, you had not allowed yourself to get so intimate with the
Trotters all this would never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>exasperated</i>). There you go again! I can't stand being jawed
at, Culchard, and I won't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> I am no more conscious of "jawing" than "jabbering,"
and if <i>that</i> is how I am to be spoken to&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> I know. Look here, it's no use. You must go to Florence
by yourself. I simply don't feel up to it, and that's the truth. I shall
just potter about here till&mdash;till <i>they</i> go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> As you choose. I gave you the opportunity&mdash;out of kindness.
If you prefer to make yourself ridiculous by hanging about here,
it's no concern of mine. I dare say I shall enjoy Florence at least as
well by myself.</p>

are received on the steps by the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Porter.</span> Goot afternoon, Schendlemen. You have a bleasant dimes

Met at Lugano, didn't we? To be sure&mdash;very pleasant chat we had
too! So you're at Venice, eh? I know every stone of it by heart, as
I needn't say. The first time I was ever at Venice&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>taking a bulky envelope from the</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span>). Just so&mdash;how
are you? Er&mdash;will you excuse me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span> <i>thrusts the letter angrily in his pocket</i>). You're
new to Venice, I think? Well, just let me give you a word of advice.
Now you <i>are</i> here&mdash;you make them give you some tunny. Insist on
it, Sir. Why, when I was here first&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Ha! well, what did you think of it? <i>Delicious</i>, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>forgetting all his manners</i>). Beastly, Sir, <i>beastly</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Leaves the scandalized</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> <i>abruptly, and rushes off to get a
telegram form at the bureau.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crawley Strutt</span> (<i>pouncing on</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>in the hall, as he
finishes the perusal of his letter</i>). Excuse me&mdash;but surely I have the
honour of addressing Lord George Gumbleton? You may perhaps
just recollect, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>blankly</i>). Think you've made a mistake, really.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. S.</span> Is it possible! I have come across so many people
while I've been away that&mdash;but surely we have met <i>somewhere</i>? Why,
of course, Sir John Jubber! you must pardon me, Sir John&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>recognizing him</i>). My name's Podbury&mdash;plain Podbury, but
you're quite right. You <i>have</i> met me&mdash;and you've met my bootmaker
too, "Lord Uppersole," eh? That's where the mistake came in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C. S.</span> (<i>with hauteur</i>). I think not, Sir; I have no recollection
of the circumstance. I see now your face is quite unfamiliar to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He moves away</i>; <span class="smcap">Podbury</span> <i>gets a telegram form and sits down
at a table in the hall opposite</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>reading over his telegram</i>). "Yours just received. Am
returning immediately."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> (<i>do., do.</i>). "Letter to hand. No end sorry. Start at once."
(<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Culchard</span>.) Writing to Florence for room, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> Er&mdash;no. The fact is, I've just heard from my Chief&mdash;a&mdash;a
most intemperate communication, insisting on my instant return to
my duties! I shall have to humour him, I suppose, and leave at
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> So shall I. No end of a shirty letter from the Governor.
Wants to know how much longer I expect him to be tied to the office.
Old humbug, when he only turns up twice a week for a couple of
hours!</p>

them. <i>I</i> don't want them! (<i>He looks at his letter once more.</i>) I say, Podbury,
it&mdash;it's worse than I thought. This thing's a week old! Must
have been lying in my rooms all this time&mdash;or else in that infernal
Italian post!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Whew, old chap! I say, I wouldn't be <i>you</i> for something!
Won't you catch it when you <i>do</i> turn up? But look here&mdash;as things
are, we may as well travel <i>home</i> together, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> (<i>with a flicker of resentment</i>). In spite of my tendency to
"jaw" and "jabber"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podb.</span> Oh, never mind all that now. We're companions in misfortune,
you know, and we'd better stick together, and keep each other's
spirits up. After all, you're in a much worse hat than <i>I</i> am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Culch.</span> If <i>that's</i> the way you propose to keep my spirits up!&mdash;--But
let us keep together, by all means, if you wish it, and just go and
find out when the next train starts, will you? (<i>To himself, as</i> <span class="smcap">Podbury</span>

dare say!</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
